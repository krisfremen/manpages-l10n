This package contains a first release of the Linux man pages in German.

Much is missing - contributions are welcome.
Mail them to aeb@cwi.nl or joey@infodrom.north.de.
Please uuencode translations - the sendmail at cwi.nl is
still from the stone age, and kills 8-bit characters.
An archive of the currently available man pages in German
can be found at ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/linux/man/de.

Install by copying to your favourite location.
"make install" will copy them to /usr/man/de/man[1-8],
where man-1.4 will find them if you set LANG=de.

If your man pager can handle compressed source pages
(man-1.4 can), you might do "make gz" before "make install",
or just say "make".

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights.
All are freely distributable when the nroff source is included.
