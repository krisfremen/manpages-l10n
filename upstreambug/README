This script is intended to ease reporting found errors to the upstream
projects.

USE CAREFUL, THE SCRIPT MAY STILL CONTAIN UNEXPECTED BUGS

Before using, read "LOCAL CONFIGURATION" and set it up accordingly. In
case the script shows errors during processing, read "UPSTREAM CONFIGURATION"
and update the upstream config files if needed.

reportupstream does not expect any parameters. It will scan for all possible
FIXMEs, sort out those which are comming from upstream (might not work
100%) and gives you a menu with the choice of packages where bugs can be
reported.

In the choice you will see also the last reporting date.

Choose one entry and the script will prepare an e-mail or a text file
ready for copying into the browser (the right URL will be opened).
You will need to review each FIXME and write clear and consise what
needs to be changed; the FIXME alone will not be sufficient! Please
be aware that upstream is not using our format (po), so explain that
the proposed change is not a real diff, upstream will have to locate
the exact file and source position.


LOCAL CONFIGURATION
Please create $HOME/.config/reportupstreamrc and add fill in the following
variables:
# The location of the git tree with the man pages
DCSBASE=/scr/build/src/DCS/manpages-l10n/
# If you have the CONFIG stored somewhere else (usually not needed)
CONFIGBASE=$DCSBASE/upstreambug/CONFIG
# If you need a different dialog programm (e.g. for X)
DIALOG=$(which dialog)
# Your e-mail programm, must be mutt(1) compatible in the calling syntax
SSF_MAILER=/usr/bin/mutt
# Your browser
SSF_BROWSER=/usr/bin/firefox
# The temporary directory for quite a few files, will be created if it does not exist
SSF_TMP=/tmp/ssf

Actually the configuration can contain any command allowed in bash(1), so
if you need to determine something, you can.


UPSTREAM CONFIGURATION
For each upstream project a file in $CONFIGBASE should exist. Since these
files are not created automatically, they might be missing and need manual
creation.

Each config file contains a few header lines (see below) and then the name of
each manual page one by one, each on a single line.

The following header lines are currently supported:
Homepage: https://...
This is the URL of the upstream project (general page)

Note: Text
Some information about reporting bugs taken from upstream (e.g. written on
their web page)

Bugtype: TYPE ADDRESS
How to report bugs.
TYPE is either either "email", "web" or "reportbug"
ADDRESS is either the appropraite e-mail-address or the web page of the bug
tracker.
