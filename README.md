This project provides an infrastructure for translating manpages to different
languages. Currently we support the following languages:

*  cs - Czech *

(the languages marked with * are currently - at least partially - unmaintained,
feel free to pick up the maintenance)

The project is open for adding more languages. For inclusion of a new one,
