# manpages-l10n

This project provides an infrastructure for translating manpages to different
languages. Currently we support the following languages:

*  de - German
*  fr - French
*  nl - Dutch *
*  ro - Romanian

(the languages marked with * are currently unmaintained, feel free to pick up
the maintenance)

The project is open for adding more languages. For inclusion of a new one,
please contact Mario Bl√§ttermann <mario.blaettermann@gmail.com>
