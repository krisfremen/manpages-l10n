.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR atanh ()
function calculates the inverse hyperbolic tangent of
\fIx\fP; that is the value whose hyperbolic tangent is \fIx\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, these functions return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of
.IR x .

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is +0 (\-0), +0 (\-0) is returned.

If
.I x
is +1 or \-1,
a pole error occurs,
and the functions return
.BR HUGE_VAL ,
.BR HUGE_VALF ,
or
.BR HUGE_VALL ,
respectively, with the mathematically correct sign.

If the absolute value of
.I x
is greater than 1,
a domain error occurs,
and a NaN is returned.
.\"
.\" POSIX.1-2001 documents an optional range error for subnormal x;
.\" glibc 2.8 does not do this.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP less than \-1 or greater than +1
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM .
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.TP
Pole error: \fIx\fP is +1 or \-1
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE
(but see BUGS).
.\" FIXME . glibc actually gives EDOM for this case
A divide-by-zero floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_DIVBYZERO )
is raised.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
.SH BUGS
For a pole error,
.\"
.\" FIXME . this is as at glibc 2.8; check later if this bug is fixed
.\" This can be seen in sysdeps/ieee754/k_standard.c
.\" Bug raised: http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6759
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM ;
POSIX.1 says it should be set to
.BR ERANGE .
