.SH NAME
font2psf \- convert a 256\-character fonts to PSF format

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI font2psf

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script converts 256 character fonts to psf-fonts
It simply assumes that all files in the current directory
that have a size of (256*n) are fontfiles of 8xn pixel"
fonts. If there are 512 character, non-psf-fonts you will
recognise this soon... Anyway, the setfont program isn't
aware of those type of fonts, so there shouldn't be too
much of them around.
.PP
This script cares for font highs of 6,8,10,12,14,16 and 19
pixels
