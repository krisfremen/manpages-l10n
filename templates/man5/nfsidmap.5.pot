#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The NFSv4 protocol represents the local system's UID and GID values on the "
"wire as strings of the form I<user@domain>.  The process of translating from "
"UID to string and string to UID is referred to as \"ID mapping.\""
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The system derives the I<user> part of the string by performing a password "
"or group lookup.  The lookup mechanism is configured in I</etc/idmapd.conf>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"By default, the I<domain> part of the string is the system's DNS domain "
"name.  It can also be specified in I</etc/idmapd.conf> if the system is "
"multi-homed, or if the system's DNS domain name does not match the name of "
"the system's Kerberos realm."

"The I</usr/sbin/nfsidmap> program performs translations on behalf of the "
"kernel.  The kernel uses the request-key mechanism to perform an upcall.  I</"
"usr/sbin/nfsidmap> is invoked by /sbin/request-key, performs the "
"translation, and initializes a key with the resulting information.  The "
"kernel then caches the translation results in the key."
