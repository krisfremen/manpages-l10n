"Configure the hardware watchdog at runtime and at reboot\\&. Takes a timeout "
"value in seconds (or in other time units if suffixed with \"ms\", \"min\", "
"\"h\", \"d\", \"w\")\\&. If I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> is set to a non-zero "
"value, the watchdog hardware (/dev/watchdog or the path specified with "
"I<WatchdogDevice=> or the kernel option I<systemd\\&.watchdog-device=>) will "
"be programmed to automatically reboot the system if it is not contacted "
"within the specified timeout interval\\&. The system manager will ensure to "
"contact it at least once in half the specified timeout interval\\&. This "
"feature requires a hardware watchdog device to be present, as it is commonly "
"the case in embedded and server systems\\&. Not all hardware watchdogs allow "
"configuration of all possible reboot timeout values, in which case the "
"closest available timeout is picked\\&.  I<RebootWatchdogSec=> may be used "
"to configure the hardware watchdog when the system is asked to reboot\\&. It "
"works as a safety net to ensure that the reboot takes place even if a clean "
"reboot attempt times out\\&. Note that the I<RebootWatchdogSec=> timeout "
"applies only to the second phase of the reboot, i\\&.e\\&. after all regular "
"services are already terminated, and after the system and service manager "
"process (PID 1) got replaced by the systemd-shutdown binary, see system "
"B<bootup>(7)  for details\\&. During the first phase of the shutdown "
"operation the system and service manager remains running and hence "
"I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> is still honoured\\&. In order to define a timeout on "
"this first phase of system shutdown, configure I<JobTimeoutSec=> and "
"I<JobTimeoutAction=> in the \"[Unit]\" section of the shutdown\\&.target unit"
"\\&. By default I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> defaults to 0 (off), and "
"I<RebootWatchdogSec=> to 10min\\&.  I<KExecWatchdogSec=> may be used to "
"additionally enable the watchdog when kexec is being executed rather than "
"when rebooting\\&. Note that if the kernel does not reset the watchdog on "
"kexec (depending on the specific hardware and/or driver), in this case the "
"watchdog might not get disabled after kexec succeeds and thus the system "
"might get rebooted, unless I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> is also enabled at the "
"same time\\&. For this reason it is recommended to enable "
"I<KExecWatchdogSec=> only if I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> is also enabled\\&. "
