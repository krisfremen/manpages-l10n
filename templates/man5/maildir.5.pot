"A machine may crash while it is delivering a message.  For both I<mbox> "
"files and I<mh> folders this means that the message will be silently "
"truncated.  Even worse: for I<mbox> format, if the message is truncated in "
"the middle of a line, it will be silently joined to the next message.  The "
"mail transport agent will try again later to deliver the message, but it is "
"unacceptable that a corrupted message should show up at all.  In I<maildir>, "
