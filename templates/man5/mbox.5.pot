"This document describes the format traditionally used by Unix hosts to store "
"mail messages locally.  B<mbox> files typically reside in the system's mail "
"spool, under various names in users' Mail directories, and under the name "
"B<mbox> in users' home directories."

"An B<mbox> is a text file containing an arbitrary number of e-mail "
"messages.  Each message consists of a postmark, followed by an e-mail "
"message formatted according to B<RFC822>, B<RFC2822>. The file format is "
"line-oriented. Lines are separated by line feed characters (ASCII 10)."

"A postmark line consists of the four characters \"From\", followed by a "

"or equal to 70 should be interpreted as the years 1970+, while two-digit "
"years less than 70 should be interpreted as the years 2000-2069. Software "
