"The file B</etc/adjtime> contains descriptive information about the hardware "
"mode clock setting and clock drift factor.  The file is read and write by "
"hwclock; and read by programs like rtcwake to get RTC time mode."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable

"The file is usually located in /etc, but tools like B<hwclock>(8)  or "
"B<rtcwake>(8)  allow to use alternative location by command line options if "
"write access to /etc is unwanted.  The default clock mode is \"UTC\" if the "
"file is missing."

"The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate.  However, much of its "
"inaccuracy is completely predictable - it gains or loses the same amount of "
"time every day.  This is called systematic drift.  The util hwclock keeps "
"the file /etc/adjtime, that keeps some historical information.  For more "
"details see \"B<The Adjust Function>\" and \"B<The Adjtime File>\" sections "
