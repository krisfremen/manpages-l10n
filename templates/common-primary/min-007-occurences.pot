"override entries in the single configuration file\\&. Files in the *\\&.conf"
"\\&.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in "

"just a single value, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest "
"name takes precedence\\&. For options which accept a list of values, entries "
"are collected as they occur in files sorted lexicographically\\&. It is "
"recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit "
"number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\\&."
