"When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install "
"configuration snippets in /usr/lib/systemd/*\\&.conf\\&.d/\\&. Files in /"
"etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to "
"override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\\&. The main "
"configuration file is read before any of the configuration directories, and "
"has the lowest precedence; entries in a file in any configuration directory "
"override entries in the single configuration file\\&. Files in the *\\&.conf"
"\\&.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in "
"lexicographic order, regardless of which of the subdirectories they reside in"
"\\&. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept "
"just a single value, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest "
"name takes precedence\\&. For options which accept a list of values, entries "
"are collected as they occur in files sorted lexicographically\\&. It is "
"recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit "
"number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\\&."
