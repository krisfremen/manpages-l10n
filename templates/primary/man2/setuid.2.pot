"B<setuid>()  sets the effective user ID of the calling process.  If the "
"calling process is privileged (more precisely: if the process has the "
"B<CAP_SETUID> capability in its user namespace), the real UID and saved "
"set-user-ID are also set."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Under Linux, B<setuid>()  is implemented like the POSIX version with the "
"B<_POSIX_SAVED_IDS> feature.  This allows a set-user-ID (other than root) "
"program to drop all of its user privileges, do some un-privileged work, and "
"then reengage the original effective user ID in a secure manner."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"If the user is root or the program is set-user-ID-root, special care must be "
"taken.  The B<setuid>()  function checks the effective user ID of the caller "
"and if it is the superuser, all process-related user ID's are set to "
"I<uid>.  After this has occurred, it is impossible for the program to regain "
"root privileges."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Thus, a set-user-ID-root program wishing to temporarily drop root "
"privileges, assume the identity of an unprivileged user, and then regain "
"root privileges afterward cannot use B<setuid>().  You can accomplish this "
"with B<seteuid>(2)."

"At the kernel level, user IDs and group IDs are a per-thread attribute.  "
"However, POSIX requires that all threads in a process share the same "
"credentials.  The NPTL threading implementation handles the POSIX "
"requirements by providing wrapper functions for the various system calls "
"that change process UIDs and GIDs.  These wrapper functions (including the "
"one for B<setuid>())  employ a signal-based technique to ensure that when "
"one thread changes credentials, all of the other threads in the process also "
"change their credentials.  For details, see B<nptl>(7)."
