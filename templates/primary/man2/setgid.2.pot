"B<setgid>()  sets the effective group ID of the calling process.  If the "
"calling process is privileged (has the B<CAP_SETGID> capability in its user "
"namespace), the real GID and saved set-group-ID are also set."

#. type: Plain text

"Under Linux, B<setgid>()  is implemented like the POSIX version with the "
"B<_POSIX_SAVED_IDS> feature.  This allows a set-group-ID program that is not "
"set-user-ID-root to drop all of its group privileges, do some un-privileged "
"work, and then reengage the original effective group ID in a secure manner."

"The original Linux B<setgid>()  system call supported only 16-bit group "
"IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added B<setgid32>()  supporting 32-bit IDs.  "
"The glibc B<setgid>()  wrapper function transparently deals with the "
"variation across kernel versions."

"At the kernel level, user IDs and group IDs are a per-thread attribute.  "
"However, POSIX requires that all threads in a process share the same "
"credentials.  The NPTL threading implementation handles the POSIX "
"requirements by providing wrapper functions for the various system calls "
"that change process UIDs and GIDs.  These wrapper functions (including the "
"one for B<setgid>())  employ a signal-based technique to ensure that when "
"one thread changes credentials, all of the other threads in the process also "
"change their credentials.  For details, see B<nptl>(7)."
