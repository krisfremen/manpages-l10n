#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The system call B<setfsgid>()  changes the value of the caller's filesystem "
"group ID\\(emthe group ID that the Linux kernel uses to check for all "
"accesses to the filesystem.  Normally, the value of the filesystem group ID "
"will shadow the value of the effective group ID.  In fact, whenever the "
"effective group ID is changed, the filesystem group ID will also be changed "
"to the new value of the effective group ID."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Explicit calls to B<setfsuid>(2)  and B<setfsgid>()  are usually used only "
"by programs such as the Linux NFS server that need to change what user and "
"group ID is used for file access without a corresponding change in the real "
"and effective user and group IDs.  A change in the normal user IDs for a "
"program such as the NFS server is a security hole that can expose it to "
"unwanted signals.  (But see below.)"

#. type: Plain text

"B<setfsgid>()  will succeed only if the caller is the superuser or if "
"I<fsgid> matches either the caller's real group ID, effective group ID, "

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Note that at the time this system call was introduced, a process could send "
"a signal to a process with the same effective user ID.  Today signal "
"permission handling is slightly different.  See B<setfsuid>(2)  for a "
"discussion of why the use of both B<setfsuid>(2)  and B<setfsgid>()  is "
"nowadays unneeded."

"The original Linux B<setfsgid>()  system call supported only 16-bit group "
"IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added B<setfsgid32>()  supporting 32-bit IDs.  "
"The glibc B<setfsgid>()  wrapper function transparently deals with the "
"variation across kernel versions."

"In glibc 2.15 and earlier, when the wrapper for this system call determines "
"that the argument can't be passed to the kernel without integer truncation "
"(because the kernel is old and does not support 32-bit group IDs), they will "
"return -1 and set I<errno> to B<EINVAL> without attempting the system call."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"No error indications of any kind are returned to the caller, and the fact "
"that both successful and unsuccessful calls return the same value makes it "
"impossible to directly determine whether the call succeeded or failed.  "
"Instead, the caller must resort to looking at the return value from a "
"further call such as I<setfsgid(-1)> (which will always fail), in order to "
"determine if a preceding call to B<setfsgid>()  changed the filesystem group "
"ID.  At the very least, B<EPERM> should be returned when the call fails "
"(because the caller lacks the B<CAP_SETGID> capability)."
