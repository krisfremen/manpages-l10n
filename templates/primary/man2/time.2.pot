"POSIX.1 defines I<seconds since the Epoch> using a formula that approximates "
"the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch.  This formula "
"takes account of the facts that all years that are evenly divisible by 4 are "
"leap years, but years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years "
"unless they are also evenly divisible by 400, in which case they are leap "
"years.  This value is not the same as the actual number of seconds between "
"the time and the Epoch, because of leap seconds and because system clocks "
"are not required to be synchronized to a standard reference.  The intention "
"is that the interpretation of seconds since the Epoch values be consistent; "
"see POSIX.1-2008 Rationale A.4.15 for further rationale."

"On Linux, a call to B<time>()  with I<tloc> specified as NULL cannot fail "
"with the error B<EOVERFLOW>, even on ABIs where I<time_t> is a signed 32-bit "
"integer and the clock ticks past the time 2**31 (2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, "
"ignoring leap seconds).  (POSIX.1 permits, but does not require, the "
"B<EOVERFLOW> error in the case where the seconds since the Epoch will not "
"fit in I<time_t>.)  Instead, the behavior on Linux is undefined when the "
"system time is out of the I<time_t> range.  Applications intended to run "
"after 2038 should use ABIs with I<time_t> wider than 32 bits."
