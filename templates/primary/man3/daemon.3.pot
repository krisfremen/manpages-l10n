"The GNU C library implementation of this function was taken from BSD, and "
"does not employ the double-fork technique (i.e., B<fork>(2), B<setsid>(2), "
"B<fork>(2))  that is necessary to ensure that the resulting daemon process "
"is not a session leader.  Instead, the resulting daemon I<is> a session "
"leader.  On systems that follow System V semantics (e.g., Linux), this means "
"that if the daemon opens a terminal that is not already a controlling "
"terminal for another session, then that terminal will inadvertently become "
"the controlling terminal for the daemon."
