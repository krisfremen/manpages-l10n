"The B<exec>()  family of functions replaces the current process image with a "

"front-ends for B<execve>(2).  (See the manual page for B<execve>(2)  for "
"further details about the replacement of the current process image.)"

"The I<const char\\ *arg> and subsequent ellipses in the B<execl>(), "
"B<execlp>(), and B<execle>()  functions can be thought of as I<arg0>, "
"I<arg1>, \\&..., I<argn>.  Together they describe a list of one or more "
"pointers to null-terminated strings that represent the argument list "
"available to the executed program.  The first argument, by convention, "
"should point to the filename associated with the file being executed.  The "
"list of arguments I<must> be terminated by a null pointer, and, since these "
"are variadic functions, this pointer must be cast I<(char\\ *) NULL>."

"terminated by a null pointer.  The other functions take the environment for "
"the new process image from the external variable I<environ> in the calling "

"On some other systems, the default path (used when the environment does not "
