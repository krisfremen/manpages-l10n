"B<system>()  provides simplicity and convenience: it handles all of the "
"details of calling B<fork>(2), B<execl>(3), and B<waitpid>(2), as well as "
"the necessary manipulations of signals; in addition, the shell performs the "
"usual substitutions and I/O redirections for I<command>.  The main cost of "
"B<system>()  is inefficiency: additional system calls are required to create "
"the process that runs the shell and to execute the shell."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"If the B<_XOPEN_SOURCE> feature test macro is defined (before including "
"I<any> header files), then the macros described in B<waitpid>(2)  "
"(B<WEXITSTATUS>(), etc.) are made available when including "
"I<E<lt>stdlib.hE<gt>>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"As mentioned, B<system>()  ignores B<SIGINT> and B<SIGQUIT>.  This may make "
"programs that call it from a loop uninterruptible, unless they take care "
"themselves to check the exit status of the child.  For example:"

"Do not use B<system>()  from a program with set-user-ID or set-group-ID "
"privileges, because strange values for some environment variables might be "
"used to subvert system integrity.  Use the B<exec>(3)  family of functions "
"instead, but not B<execlp>(3)  or B<execvp>(3).  B<system>()  will not, in "
"fact, work properly from programs with set-user-ID or set-group-ID "

"In versions of glibc before 2.1.3, the check for the availability of "

"always assumed to be available, and B<system>()  always returned 1 in this "
"case.  Since glibc 2.1.3, this check is performed because, even though "
"POSIX.1-2001 requires a conforming implementation to provide a shell, that "
"shell may not be available or executable if the calling program has "
"previously called B<chroot>(2)  (which is not specified by POSIX.1-2001)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"It is possible for the shell command to terminate with a status of 127, "
