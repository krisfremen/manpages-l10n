#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<crypt>()  is the password encryption function.  It is based on the Data "
"Encryption Standard algorithm with variations intended (among other things) "
"to discourage use of hardware implementations of a key search."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "I<key> is a user's typed password."

"I<salt> is a two-character string chosen from the set [B<a-zA-Z0-9./>].  "

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"By taking the lowest 7 bits of each of the first eight characters of the "
"I<key>, a 56-bit key is obtained.  This 56-bit key is used to encrypt "
"repeatedly a constant string (usually a string consisting of all zeros).  "
"The returned value points to the encrypted password, a series of 13 "
"printable ASCII characters (the first two characters represent the salt "
"itself).  The return value points to static data whose content is "
"overwritten by each call."

"equal 7.2e16 possible values.  Exhaustive searches of this key space are "
"possible using massively parallel computers.  Software, such as B<crack>(1), "
"is available which will search the portion of this key space that is "
"generally used by humans for passwords.  Hence, password selection should, "
"at minimum, avoid common words and names.  The use of a B<passwd>(1)  "
"program that checks for crackable passwords during the selection process is "
"recommended."

"The DES algorithm itself has a few quirks which make the use of the "
"B<crypt>()  interface a very poor choice for anything other than password "
"authentication.  If you are planning on using the B<crypt>()  interface for "
"a cryptography project, don't do it: get a good book on encryption and one "
"of the widely available DES libraries."

#.  .I codebook
#.  mode that
#.  .BR crypt ()
#.  implements.  The
#.  .BR crypt ()
#.  interface should be used only for its intended purpose of password

#.  The first and last three output bits of the fourth S-box can be
#.  represented as function of their input bits.  Empiric studies have

#.  to be considered insecure for the given reasons.
