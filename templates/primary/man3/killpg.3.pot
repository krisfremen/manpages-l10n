"There are various differences between the permission checking in BSD-type "

"B<kill>().  A difference not mentioned by POSIX concerns the return value "
"B<EPERM>: BSD documents that no signal is sent and B<EPERM> returned when "
"the permission check failed for at least one target process, while POSIX "
"documents B<EPERM> only when the permission check failed for all target "
"processes."
