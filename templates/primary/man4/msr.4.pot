"I</dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr> provides an interface to read and write the "
"model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU.  I<CPUNUM> is the number of "
"the CPU to access as listed in I</proc/cpuinfo>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The register access is done by opening the file and seeking to the MSR "
"number as offset in the file, and then reading or writing in chunks of 8 "
"bytes.  An I/O transfer of more than 8 bytes means multiple reads or writes "
"of the same register."
