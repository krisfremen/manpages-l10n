"B<uptime> gives a one line display of the following information.  The "
"current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are "
"currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 "
"minutes."

"System load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a "
"runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either "
"using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninterruptable state "
"is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are taken "
"over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the "
"number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system "
"is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of "
"the time."
