"B<shutdown> brings the system down in a secure way.  All logged-in users are "

"possible to shut the system down immediately or after a specified delay.  "
"All processes are first notified that the system is going down by the signal "
"\\s-2SIGTERM\\s0.  This gives programs like B<vi>(1)  the time to save the "
"file being edited, mail and news processing programs a chance to exit "
"cleanly, etc.  B<shutdown> does its job by signalling the B<init> process, "
"asking it to change the runlevel.  Runlevel B<0> is used to halt the system, "
"runlevel B<6> is used to reboot the system, and runlevel B<1> is used to put "
"to system into a state where administrative tasks can be performed; this is "
"the default if neither the I<-h> or I<-r> flag is given to B<shutdown>.  To "
"see which actions are taken on halt or reboot see the appropriate entries "
