#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fsfreeze> halts any new access to the filesystem and creates a stable "
"image on disk.  B<fsfreeze> is intended to be used with hardware RAID "
"devices that support the creation of snapshots."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fsfreeze> is unnecessary for B<device-mapper> devices.  The device-mapper "
"(and LVM) automatically freezes a filesystem on the device when a snapshot "
"creation is requested.  For more details see the B<dmsetup>(8)  man page."

"The I<mountpoint> argument is the pathname of the directory where the "
"filesystem is mounted.  The filesystem must be mounted to be frozen (see "
"B<mount>(8))."

#. type: Plain text

"Note that access-time updates are also suspended if the filesystem is "
"mounted with the traditional atime behavior (mount option B<strictatime>, "
"for more details see B<mount>(8))."

"This option requests the specified a filesystem to be frozen from new "
"modifications.  When this is selected, all ongoing transactions in the "
"filesystem are allowed to complete, new write system calls are halted, other "
"calls which modify the filesystem are halted, and all dirty data, metadata, "
"and log information are written to disk.  Any process attempting to write to "
"the frozen filesystem will block waiting for the filesystem to be unfrozen."
