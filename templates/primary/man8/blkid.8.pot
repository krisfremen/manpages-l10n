msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The B<blkid> program is the command-line interface to working with the "
"B<libblkid>(3)  library.  It can determine the type of content "
"(e.g. filesystem or swap)  that a block device holds, and also the "
"attributes (tokens, NAME=value pairs)  from the content metadata (e.g. LABEL "
"or UUID fields)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<It is recommended to use> B<lsblk>(8)  B<command to get information about "
"block devices rather than blkid.> B<lsblk>(8)  provides more information, "
"better control on output formatting and it does not require root permissions "
"to get actual information."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"When I<device> is specified, tokens from only this device are displayed.  It "
"is possible to specify multiple I<device> arguments on the command line.  If "
"none is given, all devices which appear in I</proc/partitions> are shown, if "
"they are recognized."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Note that B<blkid> reads information directly from devices and for non-root "
"users it returns cached unverified information.  It is better to use B<lsblk "
"--fs> to get a user-friendly overview of filesystems and devices.  "
"B<lsblk>(8)  is also easy to use in scripts.  B<blkid> is mostly designed "
"for system services and to test libblkid functionality."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"B<blkid> has two main forms of operation: either searching for a device with "
