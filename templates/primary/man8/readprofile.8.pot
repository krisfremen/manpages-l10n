msgid ""
"The B<readprofile> command uses the I</proc/profile> information to print "
"ascii data on standard output.  The output is organized in three columns: "
"the first is the number of clock ticks, the second is the name of the C "
"function in the kernel where those many ticks occurred, and the third is the "
"normalized `load' of the procedure, calculated as a ratio between the number "
"of ticks and the length of the procedure.  The output is filled with blanks "
"to ease readability."

"To enable profiling, the kernel must be rebooted, because no profiling "
