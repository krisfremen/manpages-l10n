"systemd-remount-fs\\&.service is an early boot service that applies mount "
"options listed in B<fstab>(5)  to the root file system, the /usr file "
"system, and the kernel API file systems\\&. This is required so that the "
"mount options of these file systems \\(em which are pre-mounted by the "
"kernel, the initial RAM disk, container environments or system manager code "
"\\(em are updated to those listed in /etc/fstab\\&. This service ignores "
"normal file systems and only changes the root file system (i\\&.e\\&.  /), "
"/usr and the virtual kernel API file systems such as /proc, /sys or "
"/dev\\&. This service executes no operation if /etc/fstab does not exist or "
"lists no entries for the mentioned file systems\\&."
