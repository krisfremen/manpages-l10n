"Under older B<sysvinit> releases , B<reboot> and B<halt> should never be "

"B<shutdown>(8) if the system is not in runlevel 0 or 6. This means that if "
"B<halt> or B<reboot> cannot find out the current runlevel (for example, when "
"I</var/run/utmp> hasn't been initialized correctly) B<shutdown> will be "

"The B<-h> flag puts all hard disks in standby mode just before halt or "

"flushed. This is important for IDE drives, since the kernel doesn't flush "
"the write cache itself before power-off."

"The B<halt> program uses /proc/ide/hd* to find all IDE disk devices, which "
