"Network configurations applied before networkd is started are not removed, "
"and static configuration applied by networkd is not removed when networkd "
"exits\\&. Dynamic configuration applied by networkd may also optionally be "
"left in place on shutdown\\&. This ensures restarting networkd does not cut "
"the network connection, and, in particular, that it is safe to transition "
"between the initrd and the real root, and back\\&."
