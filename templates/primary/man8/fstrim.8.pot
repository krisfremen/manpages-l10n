msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fstrim> is used on a mounted filesystem to discard (or \"trim\") blocks "
"which are not in use by the filesystem.  This is useful for solid-state "
"drives (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"By default, B<fstrim> will discard all unused blocks in the filesystem.  "
"Options may be used to modify this behavior based on range or size, as "
"explained below."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The I<mountpoint> argument is the pathname of the directory where the "
"filesystem is mounted."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Running B<fstrim> frequently, or even using B<mount -o discard>, might "
"negatively affect the lifetime of poor-quality SSD devices.  For most "
"desktop and server systems a sufficient trimming frequency is once a week.  "
"Note that not all devices support a queued trim, so each trim command incurs "
"a performance penalty on whatever else might be trying to use the disk at "
"the time."

"The I<offset>, I<length>, and I<minimum-size> arguments may be followed by "
"the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for "
"GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the \"iB\" is optional, e.g., \"K\" has the "
"same meaning as \"KiB\") or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so "
"on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB."

"Trim all mounted filesystems on devices that support the discard operation.  "

"Minimum contiguous free range to discard, in bytes. (This value is "
"internally rounded up to a multiple of the filesystem block size.)  Free "
"ranges smaller than this will be ignored.  By increasing this value, the "
"fstrim operation will complete more quickly for filesystems with badly "
"fragmented freespace, although not all blocks will be discarded.  The "
"default value is zero, discarding every free block."

"Verbose execution.  With this option B<fstrim> will output the number of "
"bytes passed from the filesystem down the block stack to the device for "
"potential discard.  This number is a maximum discard amount from the storage "
"device's perspective, because I<FITRIM> ioctl called repeated will keep "
"sending the same sectors for discard repeatedly."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fstrim> will report the same potential discard bytes each time, but only "
"sectors which had been written to between the discards would actually be "
"discarded by the storage device.  Further, the kernel block layer reserves "
"the right to adjust the discard ranges to fit raid stripe geometry, non-trim "
"capable devices in a LVM setup, etc.  These reductions would not be "
"reflected in fstrim_range.len (the B<--length> option)."
