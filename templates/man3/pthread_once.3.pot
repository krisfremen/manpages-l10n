"The purpose of B<pthread_once> is to ensure that a piece of initialization "
"code is executed at most once. The I<once_control> argument points to a "
"static or extern variable statically initialized to B<PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT>."

"The first time B<pthread_once> is called with a given I<once_control> "
"argument, it calls I<init_routine> with no argument and changes the value of "
"the I<once_control> variable to record that initialization has been "
"performed. Subsequent calls to B<pthread_once> with the same B<once_control> "
"argument do nothing."
