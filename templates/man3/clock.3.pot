"The C standard allows for arbitrary values at the start of the program; "

"program to get maximum portability."

"Note that the time can wrap around.  On a 32-bit system where "
"B<CLOCKS_PER_SEC> equals 1000000 this function will return the same value "
"approximately every 72 minutes."
msgstr ""

#.  I have seen this behavior on Irix 6.3, and the OSF/1, HP/UX, and
#.  Solaris manual pages say that clock() also does this on those systems.
#.  POSIX.1-2001 doesn't explicitly allow this, nor is there an
#.  explicit prohibition. -- MTK

"On several other implementations, the value returned by B<clock>()  also "
"includes the times of any children whose status has been collected via "
"B<wait>(2)  (or another wait-type call).  Linux does not include the times "
"of waited-for children in the value returned by B<clock>().  The "
"B<times>(2)  function, which explicitly returns (separate) information about "
"the caller and its children, may be preferable."

"In glibc 2.17 and earlier, B<clock>()  was implemented on top of "
