"The B<pthread_spin_lock>()  function locks the spin lock referred to by "
"I<lock>.  If the spin lock is currently unlocked, the calling thread "
"acquires the lock immediately.  If the spin lock is currently locked by "
"another thread, the calling thread spins, testing the lock until it becomes "
"available, at which point the calling thread acquires the lock."
