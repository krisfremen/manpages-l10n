"B<shm_open>()  creates and opens a new, or opens an existing, POSIX shared "
"memory object.  A POSIX shared memory object is in effect a handle which can "
"be used by unrelated processes to B<mmap>(2)  the same region of shared "
"memory.  The B<shm_unlink>()  function performs the converse operation, "
"removing an object previously created by B<shm_open>()."
msgstr ""

#.  glibc allows the initial slash to be omitted, and makes
#.  multiple initial slashes equivalent to a single slash.
#.  This differs from the implementation of POSIX message queues.
#.  glibc allows subdirectory components in the name, in which
#.  case the subdirectory must exist under /dev/shm, and allow the
#.  required permissions if a user wants to create a shared memory
#.  object in that subdirectory.
