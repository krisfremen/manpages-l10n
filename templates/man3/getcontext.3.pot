"The earliest incarnation of this mechanism was the B<setjmp>(3)/"

"signal context, the next stage was the B<sigsetjmp>(3)/B<siglongjmp>(3)  "
"pair.  The present mechanism gives much more control.  On the other hand, "
"there is no easy way to detect whether a return from B<getcontext>()  is "
"from the first call, or via a B<setcontext>()  call.  The user has to invent "
"their own bookkeeping device, and a register variable won't do since "
