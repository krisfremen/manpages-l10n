"The B<veth> devices are virtual Ethernet devices.  They can act as tunnels "
"between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device "
"in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."

"B<veth> device pairs are useful for combining the network facilities of the "
"kernel together in interesting ways.  A particularly interesting use case is "
"to place one end of a B<veth> pair in one network namespace and the other "
"end in another network namespace, thus allowing communication between "
"network namespaces.  To do this, one first creates the B<veth> device as "
"above and then moves one side of the pair to the other namespace:"
