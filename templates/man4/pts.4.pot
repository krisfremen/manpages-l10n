"The file I</dev/ptmx> is a character file with major number 5 and minor "
"number 2, usually with mode 0666 and ownership root:root.  It is used to "
"create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair."

"When a process opens I</dev/ptmx>, it gets a file descriptor for a "
"pseudoterminal master (PTM), and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device is "
"created in the I</dev/pts> directory.  Each file descriptor obtained by "
"opening I</dev/ptmx> is an independent PTM with its own associated PTS, "
"whose path can be found by passing the file descriptor to B<ptsname>(3)."

"Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave provides "

"In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators "
"such as B<xterm>(1), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is "
"interpreted by the application in the same way a real terminal would "
"interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login programs such as "
"B<sshd>(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across "
"the network to a client program that is connected to a terminal or terminal "
"emulator."
