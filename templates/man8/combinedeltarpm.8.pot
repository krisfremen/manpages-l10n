"combinedeltarpm creates a new deltarpm from multiple old ones.  Applying the "
"rsulting deltarpm has the same effect as applying each of the old ones in "
"the specified order. Use the B<-v> option to make combinedeltarpm more "
"verbose about its work."

"combinedeltarpm normally produces a V3 format deltarpm, use the B<-V> option "
"to specify a different version if desired. The B<-z> option can be used to "
"specify a different compression method, the default is to use the same "
"compression method as used in the last of the old deltarpms."

"If you want to use a different header signature you can also specify a rpm "

"feature can be used to if a deltarpm was made against an unsigned rpm which "
"later got signed."

"The implementation of combinedeltarpm currently unpacks the add-blocks of "
"the deltarpms in memory, thus it needs about twice the uncompressed payload "
