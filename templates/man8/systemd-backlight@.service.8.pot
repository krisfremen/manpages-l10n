"systemd-backlight@\\&.service is a service that restores the display "
"backlight brightness at early boot and saves it at shutdown\\&. On disk, the "
"backlight brightness is stored in /var/lib/systemd/backlight/\\&. During "
"loading, if the udev property B<ID_BACKLIGHT_CLAMP> is not set to false, the "
"brightness is clamped to a value of at least 1 or 5% of maximum brightness, "
"whichever is greater\\&. This restriction will be removed when the kernel "
"allows user space to reliably set a brightness value which does not turn off "
"the display\\&."
