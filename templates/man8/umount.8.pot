msgid ""
"The B<umount> command detaches the mentioned file system(s) from the file "
"hierarchy.  A file system is specified by giving the directory where it has "
"been mounted.  Giving the special device on which the file system lives may "
"also work, but is obsolete, mainly because it will fail in case this device "
"was mounted on more than one directory."

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"Note that a file system cannot be unmounted when it is 'busy' - for example, "
"when there are open files on it, or when some process has its working "
"directory there, or when a swap file on it is in use.  The offending process "
"could even be B<umount> itself - it opens libc, and libc in its turn may "
"open for example locale files.  A lazy unmount avoids this problem, but it "
"may introduce another issues. See B<--lazy> description below."
