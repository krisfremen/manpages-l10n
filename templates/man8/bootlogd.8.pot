"Bootlogd works by redirecting the console output from the console device.  "
"(Consequently B<bootlogd> requires PTY support in the kernel "
"configuration.)  It copies that output to the real console device and to a "
"log file.  There is no standard way of ascertaining the real console device "
"if you have a new-style I</dev/console> device (major 5, minor 1)  so "
"B<bootlogd> parses the kernel command line looking for B<console=...> lines "
"and deduces the real console device from that.  If that syntax is ever "
"changed by the kernel, or a console type is used that B<bootlogd> does not "
"know about then B<bootlogd> will not work."
