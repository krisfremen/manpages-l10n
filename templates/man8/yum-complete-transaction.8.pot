"B<yum-complete-transaction> is a program which finds incomplete or aborted "
"yum transactions on a system and attempts to complete them. It looks at the "
"transaction-all* and transaction-done* files which can normally be found in /"
"var/lib/yum if a yum transaction aborted in the middle of execution."

"If it finds more than one unfinished transaction it will attempt to complete "
"the most recent one first. You can run it more than once to clean up all "
"unfinished transactions."
