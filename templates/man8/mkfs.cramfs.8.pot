"Files on cramfs file systems are zlib-compressed one page at a time to allow "
"random read access.  The metadata is not compressed, but is expressed in a "
"terse representation that is more space-efficient than conventional file "
"systems."

"The file system is intentionally read-only to simplify its design; random "
"write access for compressed files is difficult to implement.  cramfs ships "
"with a utility (mkcramfs) to pack files into new cramfs images."
