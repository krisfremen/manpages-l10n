"B<qmail-queue> reads a mail message from descriptor 0.  It then reads "
"envelope information from descriptor 1.  It places the message into the "
"outgoing queue for future delivery by B<qmail-send>."

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The envelope information is an envelope sender address followed by a list of "
"envelope recipient addresses.  The sender address is preceded by the letter "
"F and terminated by a 0 byte.  Each recipient address is preceded by the "
"letter T and terminated by a 0 byte.  The list of recipient addresses is "
"terminated by an extra 0 byte.  If B<qmail-queue> sees end-of-file before "
"the extra 0 byte, it aborts without placing the message into the queue."

"B<qmail-queue> always adds a B<Received> line to the top of the message.  "

"expect to see a proper header, as described in B<qmail-header(5)>."
