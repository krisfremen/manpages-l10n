"By default, the locale package which provides the base support for "
"localisation of libc-based programs does not contain usable localisation "
"files for every supported language. This limitation has became necessary "
"because of the substantial size of such files and the large number of "
"languages supported by libc. As a result, Debian uses a special mechanism "
"where we prepare the actual localisation files on the target host and "
"distribute only the templates for them."
