"B<nss-myhostname> is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) "
"functionality of the GNU C Library (B<glibc>), primarily providing hostname "
"resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by "
"B<gethostname>(2)\\&. The precise hostnames resolved by this module are:"

"The local, configured hostname is resolved to all locally configured IP "
"addresses ordered by their scope, or \\(em if none are configured \\(em the "

"IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host)\\&."

"The hostname \"_gateway\" is resolved to all current default routing gateway "

"Various software relies on an always-resolvable local hostname\\&. When "
"using dynamic hostnames, this is traditionally achieved by patching /etc/"
"hosts at the same time as changing the hostname\\&. This is problematic "
"since it requires a writable /etc file system and is fragile because the "
"file might be edited by the administrator at the same time\\&. With B<nss-"
"myhostname> enabled, changing /etc/hosts is unnecessary, and on many "
"systems, the file becomes entirely optional\\&."
