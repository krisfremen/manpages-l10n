"All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file "

"Note that trying to mount a tmpfs with an mpol option will fail if the "
"running kernel does not support NUMA; and will fail if its nodelist "
"specifies a node which is not online.  If your system relies on that tmpfs "
"being mounted, but from time to time runs a kernel built without NUMA "
"capability (perhaps a safe recovery kernel), or with fewer nodes online, "
"then it is advisable to omit the mpol option from automatic mount options.  "
"It can be added later, when the tmpfs is already mounted on MountPoint, by "
"'mount -o remount,mpol=Policy:NodeList MountPoint'."
