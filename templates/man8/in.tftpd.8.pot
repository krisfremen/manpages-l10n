"E<.Nm Tftpd> is a server which supports the E<.Tn DARPA> Trivial File "
"Transfer Protocol.  The E<.Tn TFTP> server operates at the port indicated in "
"the E<.Ql tftp> service description; see E<.Xr services 5>.  The server is "
"normally started by E<.Xr inetd 8>."

"The use of E<.Xr tftp 1> does not require an account or password on the "
"remote system.  Due to the lack of authentication information, E<.Nm tftpd> "
"will allow only publicly readable files to be accessed.  Files may be "
"written only if they already exist and are publicly writable.  Note that "
"this extends the concept of E<.Dq public> to include all users on all hosts "
"that can be reached through the network; this may not be appropriate on all "
"systems, and its implications should be considered before enabling tftp "
"service.  The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible "
"privilege."

"Access to files may be controlled by invoking E<.Nm tftpd> with a list of "
"directories by including pathnames as server program arguments in E<.Pa /etc/"
"inetd.conf>.  In this case access is restricted to files whose names are "
"prefixed by the one of the given directories. If no directories are supplied "
"the default is E<.Pa /tftpboot>.  To give out access to the whole "
"filesystem, should this be desired for some reason, supply E<.Pa / > as an "
"argument."

"Unfortunately, on multi-homed systems, it is impossible for E<.Nm tftpd> to "
"determine the address on which a packet was received. As a result, E<.Nm "
"tftpd> uses two different mechanisms to guess the best source address to use "
"for replies. If the socket that E<.Xr inetd 8> passed to E<.Nm tftpd> is "
"bound to a particular address, E<.Nm tftpd> uses that address for replies. "
"Otherwise, E<.Nm tftpd> uses ``UDP connect'' to let the kernel choose the "
"reply address based on the destination of the replies and the routing "
"tables. This means that most setups will work transparently, while in cases "
"where the reply address must be fixed, the virtual hosting feature of E<.Xr "
"inetd 8> can be used to ensure that replies go out from the correct "
"address.  These considerations are important, because most tftp clients will "
"reject reply packets that appear to come from an unexpected address."
