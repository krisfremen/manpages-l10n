"B<qmail-popup> expects descriptor 0 to read from the network and descriptor "
"1 to write to the network.  It reads a username and password from descriptor "

"descriptor 3 reading the username, a 0 byte, the password, another 0 byte, "
"an APOP timestamp derived from I<hostname>, and a final 0 byte.  B<qmail-"
