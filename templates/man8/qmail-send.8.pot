"B<qmail-send> handles messages placed into the outgoing queue by B<qmail-"
"queue>.  It uses B<qmail-lspawn> to deliver messages to local recipients and "
"B<qmail-rspawn> to deliver messages to remote recipients.  If a message is "
"temporarily undeliverable to one or more addresses, B<qmail-send> leaves it "
"in the queue and tries the addresses again later."
