"B<e2mmpstatus> is used to check Multiple-Mount Protection (MMP) status of an "
"ext4 filesystem with the B<mmp> feature enabled.  The specified "
"I<filesystem> can be a device name (e.g.  I</dev/hdc1>, I</dev/sdb2>), or an "
"ext4 filesystem label or UUID, for example B<UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-"
"bfc24057f7bd> or B<LABEL=root>.  By default, the B<e2mmpstatus> program "
