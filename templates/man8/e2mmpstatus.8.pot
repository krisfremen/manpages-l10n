"B<e2mmpstatus> is used to check Multiple-Mount Protection (MMP) status of an "
"ext4 file system with the B<mmp> feature enabled.  The specified I<file "

"file system label or UUID, for example B<UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-"
"bfc24057f7bd> or B<LABEL=root>.  By default, the B<e2mmpstatus> program "
