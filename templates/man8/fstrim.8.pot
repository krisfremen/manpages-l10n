#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-buster debian-unstable mageia-cauldron
msgid ""
"B<fstrim> is used on a mounted filesystem to discard (or \"trim\") blocks "
"which are not in use by the filesystem.  This is useful for solid-state "
"drives (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-buster debian-unstable mageia-cauldron
msgid ""
"By default, B<fstrim> will discard all unused blocks in the filesystem.  "
"Options may be used to modify this behavior based on range or size, as "
"explained below."

"Running B<fstrim> frequently, or even using B<mount -o discard>, might "
"negatively affect the lifetime of poor-quality SSD devices.  For most "
"desktop and server systems a sufficient trimming frequency is once a week.  "
"Note that not all devices support a queued trim, so each trim command incurs "
"a performance penalty on whatever else might be trying to use the disk at "
"the time."
