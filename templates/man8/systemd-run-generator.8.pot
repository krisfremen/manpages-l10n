"If the B<systemd\\&.run=> option is specified and followed by a command "
"line, a unit named kernel-command-line\\&.service is generated for it and "
"booted into\\&. The service has I<Type=oneshot> set, and has "
"I<SuccessAction=exit> and I<FailureAction=exit> configured by default, thus "
"ensuring that the system is shut down as soon as the command completes\\&. "
"The exit status of the command line is propagated to the invoking container "
"manager, if this applies (which might propagate this further, to the calling "
"shell \\(em e\\&.g\\&.  B<systemd-nspawn>(7)  does this)\\&. If this option "
"is used multiple times the unit file will contain multiple I<ExecStart=> "
"lines, to execute all commands in order\\&. The command is started as "
"regular service, i\\&.e\\&. with I<DefaultDependencies=> on\\&."
