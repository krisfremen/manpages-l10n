"Searches the system for all LVM logical volumes containing an ext2, ext3, or "
"ext4 file system, and checks them for problems.  The checking is performed "
"by invoking the B<e2scrub> tool, which will look for corruptions.  Corrupt "
"file systems will be tagged as having errors so that fsck will be invoked "
"before the next mount.  If no errors are encountered, B<fstrim> will be "
"called on the file system if it is mounted.  See the B<e2scrub> manual page "
"for more information about how the checking is performed."
