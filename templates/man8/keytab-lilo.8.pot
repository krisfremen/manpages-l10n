"B<keytab-lilo> is a program which compiles keytable definitions (in the "
"format specified in B<keytables(5)>)  into a format which can be used by "
"B<lilo(8)> to set the keyboard type when booting [using the B<keytable> "
"parameter in B</etc/lilo.conf>]."

"I<kbd_layout> should be the name of a map file which specifies the desired "
"keyboard layout. This file may be a B<gzip(1)> compressed map. If no file "
"extension is given, B<.map.gz> is assumed. If the full pathname is not "
"specified, B</usr/share/keymaps/> is assumed."

"Since B<lilo> essentially needs to know the differences between the BIOS "
"keyboard mapping and the one you require, the I<default_layout> file should "
"contain a B<keytables(5)> file for the BIOS default mapping. If no "
"I<default_layout> file is specified, B<us.map.gz> is used."

"B<keytab-lilo> writes the output translation table as a binary string to "
"standard output, so you should redirect it to a suitable file.  B<lilo> has "
"no particular restrictions on the name of keyboard translation files, but "
"the suggested naming convention and location is B</boot/>I<mapping>B<.ktl> "
"(where B<.ktl> stands for \"Keyboard Table for Lilo\")."
