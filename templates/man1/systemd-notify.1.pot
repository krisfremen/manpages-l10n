"B<systemd-notify> may be called by daemon scripts to notify the init system "
"about status changes\\&. It can be used to send arbitrary information, "
"encoded in an environment-block-like list of strings\\&. Most importantly, "
"it can be used for start-up completion notification\\&."

"This is mostly just a wrapper around B<sd_notify()> and makes this "
"functionality available to shell scripts\\&. For details see "
"B<sd_notify>(3)\\&."

"Note that B<sd_notify()> notifications may be attributed to units correctly "
"only if either the sending process is still around at the time PID 1 "
"processes the message, or if the sending process is explicitly runtime-"
"tracked by the service manager\\&. The latter is the case if the service "
"manager originally forked off the process, i\\&.e\\&. on all processes that "
"match I<NotifyAccess=>B<main> or I<NotifyAccess=>B<exec>\\&. Conversely, if "
"an auxiliary process of the unit sends an B<sd_notify()> message and "
"immediately exits, the service manager might not be able to properly "
"attribute the message to the unit, and thus will ignore it, even if "
"I<NotifyAccess=>B<all> is set for it\\&."

"B<systemd-notify> will first attempt to invoke B<sd_notify()> pretending to "
"have the PID of the invoking process\\&. This will only succeed when invoked "
"with sufficient privileges\\&. On failure, it will then fall back to "
"invoking it under its own PID\\&. This behaviour is useful in order that "
"when the tool is invoked from a shell script the shell process \\(em and not "
"the B<systemd-notify> process \\(em appears as sender of the message, which "
"in turn is helpful if the shell process is the main process of a service, "
"due to the limitations of I<NotifyAccess=>B<all> described above\\&."
