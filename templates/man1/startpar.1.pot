"startpar is used to run multiple run-level scripts in parallel.  The degree "
"of parallelism on one B<CPU> can be set with the B<-p> option, the default "
"is full parallelism. An argument to all of the scripts can be provided with "
"the B<-a> option.  Processes blocked by pending B<I/O> will cause new "
"process creation to be weighted by the iorate factor I<800>.  To change this "
"factor the option B<-i> can be used to specify another value.  The amount"

"The output of each script is buffered and written when the script exits, so "
"output lines of different scripts won't mix. You can modify this behaviour "
"by setting a timeout."

"The timeout set with the B<-t> option is used as buffer timeout. If the "
"output buffer of a script is not empty and the last output was I<timeout> "
"seconds ago, startpar will flush the buffer."

"The B<-T> option timeout works more globally. If no output is printed for "
"more than I<global_timeout> seconds, startpar will flush the buffer of the "
"script with the oldest output. Afterwards it will only print output of this "
"script until it is finished."

"The B<-M> option switches B<startpar> into a B<make>(1)  like behaviour.  "
"This option takes three different arguments: I<boot>, I<start>, and I<stop> "
"for reading I<.depend.boot> or I<.depend.start> or I<.depend.stop> "
"respectively in the directory I</etc/init.d/>.  By scanning the boot and "
"runlevel scripts in I</etc/init.d/> it then executes the appropriate scripts "
