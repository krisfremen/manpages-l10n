"The \\&CW<mtoolstest> command is used to tests the mtools configuration "
"files. To invoke it, just type \\&CW<mtoolstest> without any arguments.  \\&"
"\\&CW<Mtoolstest> reads the mtools configuration files, and prints the "
"cumulative configuration to \\&CW<stdout>. The output can be used as a "
"configuration file itself (although you might want to remove redundant "
"clauses).  You may use this program to convert old-style configuration files "
"into new style configuration files."

"This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo "
"documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some items, "
"such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this translation "
"process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the "
"manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has been translated into the "
"manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo "
"doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo "
"doc."
