"I<PolyglotMan > takes man pages from most of the popular flavors of UNIX and "
"transforms them into any of a number of text source formats. PolyglotMan was "
"formerly known as RosettaMan. The name of the binary is still called "
"I<rman>, for scripts that depend on that name; mnemonically, just think "
"\"reverse man\". Previously I< PolyglotMan > required pages to be formatted "
"by nroff(1) prior to its processing. With version 3.0, it I<prefers [tn]roff "

"In parsing [tn]roff source, one could implement an arbitrarily large subset "

"including tbl (but not eqn), if tests, and general macro definitions, so "
"usually the results look great. If they don't, format the page with nroff "

"[tn]roff source using the .so (source or inclusion) macro, you should be in "
