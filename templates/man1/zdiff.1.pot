"I<Zcmp> and I<zdiff> are used to invoke the I<cmp> or the I<diff> program on "
"files compressed via I<gzip>.  All options specified are passed directly to "
"I<cmp> or I<diff>.  If only I<file1> is specified, it is compared to the "
"uncompressed contents of I<file1>.gz.  If two files are specified, their "
"contents (uncompressed if necessary) are fed to I<cmp> or I<diff>.  The "
"input files are not modified.  The exit status from I<cmp> or I<diff> is "
"preserved."
