msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that "
"output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script "
"was recorded."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that were run "
"when the typescript was being recorded are not run again.  Since the same "
"information is simply being displayed, B<scriptreplay> is only guaranteed to "
"work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript was "
"recorded on.  Otherwise, any escape characters in the typescript may be "
"interpreted differently by the terminal to which B<scriptreplay> is sending "
"its output."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The timing information is what B<script>(1)  outputs to standard error if it "
"is run with the B<-t> parameter."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named B<typescript>, "
"but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter or with option "
"B<-s>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a speed-up multiplier.  "
"For example, a speed-up of 2 makes B<scriptreplay> go twice as fast, and a "
"speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the original session."
