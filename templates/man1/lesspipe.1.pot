"Usually B<lesspipe.sh> is called as an input filter to B<less>.  With the "
"help of that filter B<less> will display the uncompressed contents of "
"compressed (I<gzip, bzip2, compress, zstd, lz4, lzip, xz, lzma or brotli>) "
"files. For files containing archives and directories, a table of contents "
"will be displayed (I<tar, ar, zip, i7-zip, rar, jar, rpm, deb ms-cabinet and "
"iso formats>).  Many other files will be reformatted for display. It "
"includes I<pdf, dvi, markdown, Office (MS and Openoffice)> suites formats, "
"I<NetCDF, matlab, html> and I<media (image, audio and video)> formats. This "
"does require helper programs being installed."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"The filter does not only display the above mentioned file formats, but can "
"also be applied recursively and be used to extract and display files in "

"decompression algorithm counts as a separate level."

"If the file utility reports text with an encoding different from the one "
