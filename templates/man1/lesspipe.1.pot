"Usually B<lesspipe.sh> is called as an input filter to B<less> With the help "
"of that filter B<less> will display the uncompressed contents of compressed "
"(gzip, bzip2, compress, rar, 7-zip, lzip, xz or lzma) files.  For files "
"containing archives and directories, a table of contents will be displayed "
"(e.g tar, ar, rar, jar, rpm and deb formats). Other supported formats "
"include nroff, pdf, ps, dvi, shared library, MS word, OASIS (e.g. "
"Openoffice), NetCDF, html, mp3, jpg, png, iso images, MacOSX bom, plist and "
"archive formats, perl storable data and gpg encrypted files.  This does "
"require additional helper programs being installed."
