"B<tailf is deprecated.> It may have unfixed bugs and will be removed from "
"util-linux in March 2017.  Nowadays it's safe to use B<tail -f> (from "
"coreutils), in contrast to what the original documentation below says."

"B<tailf> will print out the last 10 lines of the given I<file> and then wait "
"for this I<file> to grow.  It is similar to B<tail -f> but does not access "
"the file when it is not growing.  This has the side effect of not updating "
"the access time for the file, so a filesystem flush does not occur "
"periodically when no log activity is happening."

"B<tailf> is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a laptop when "
"logging is infrequent and the user wishes the hard disk to spin down to "
"conserve battery life."
