"B<lzmainfo> shows information stored in the B<.lzma> file header.  It reads "
"the first 13 bytes from the specified I<file>, decodes the header, and "
"prints it to standard output in human readable format.  If no I<files> are "
"given or I<file> is B<->, standard input is read."

"Usually the most interesting information is the uncompressed size and the "
"dictionary size.  Uncompressed size can be shown only if the file is in the "
"non-streamed B<.lzma> format variant.  The amount of memory required to "
"decompress the file is a few dozen kilobytes plus the dictionary size."
