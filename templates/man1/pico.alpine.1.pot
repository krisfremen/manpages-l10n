"I<Pico> is a simple, display-oriented text editor based on the Alpine "

"Editing commands are entered using control-key combinations.  As a work-"
"around for communications programs that swallow certain control characters, "
"you can emulate a control key by pressing ESCAPE twice, followed by the "
"desired control character, e.g. \"ESC ESC c\" would be equivalent to "
"entering a ctrl-c.  The editor has five basic features: paragraph "
"justification, searching, block cut/paste, a spelling checker, and a file "
"browser."
