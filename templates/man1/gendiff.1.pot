"B<gendiff> is a rather simple script which aids in generating a diff file "
"from a single directory.  It takes a directory name and a \"diff-extension\" "
"as its only arguments.  The diff extension should be a unique sequence of "
"characters added to the end of all original, unmodified files.  The output "
"of the program is a diff file which may be applied with the B<patch> program "
"to recreate the changes."

"The usual sequence of events for creating a diff is to create two identical "
"directories, make changes in one directory, and then use the B<diff> utility "
"to create a list of differences between the two.  Using gendiff eliminates "
"the need for the extra, original and unmodified directory copy.  Instead, "
"only the individual files that are modified need to be saved."

"Before editing a file, copy the file, appending the extension you have "
"chosen to the filename.  I.e. if you were going to edit somefile.cpp and "
"have chosen the extension \"fix\", copy it to somefile.cpp.fix before "
"editing it.  Then edit the first copy (somefile.cpp)."
