"Network namespaces provide isolation of the system resources associated with "
"networking: network devices, IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks, IP routing "
"tables, firewall rules, the I</proc/net> directory (which is a symbolic link "
"to I</proc/PID/net>), the I</sys/class/net> directory, various files under "
"I</proc/sys/net>, port numbers (sockets), and so on.  In addition, network "
"namespaces isolate the UNIX domain abstract socket namespace (see "
"B<unix>(7))."

"A physical network device can live in exactly one network namespace.  When a "
"network namespace is freed (i.e., when the last process in the namespace "
"terminates), its physical network devices are moved back to the initial "
"network namespace (not to the parent of the process)."

"A virtual network (B<veth>(4))  device pair provides a pipe-like abstraction "
"that can be used to create tunnels between network namespaces, and can be "
"used to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace.  "
"When a namespace is freed, the B<veth>(4)  devices that it contains are "
"destroyed."
