"A number of different components are involved in the system boot\\&. "
"Immediately after power-up, the system BIOS will do minimal hardware "
"initialization, and hand control over to a boot loader stored on a "
"persistent storage device\\&. This boot loader will then invoke an OS kernel "
"from disk (or the network)\\&. In the Linux case, this kernel (optionally) "
"extracts and executes an initial RAM disk image (initrd), such as generated "
"by B<dracut>(8), which looks for the root file system (possibly using "
"B<systemd>(1)  for this)\\&. After the root file system is found and "
"mounted, the initrd hands over control to the host\\*(Aqs system manager "
"(such as B<systemd>(1)) stored on the OS image, which is then responsible "
"for probing all remaining hardware, mounting all necessary file systems and "
"spawning all configured services\\&."
