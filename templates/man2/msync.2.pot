"B<msync>()  flushes changes made to the in-core copy of a file that was "
"mapped into memory using B<mmap>(2)  back to the filesystem.  Without use of "
"this call, there is no guarantee that changes are written back before "
"B<munmap>(2)  is called.  To be more precise, the part of the file that "
"corresponds to the memory area starting at I<addr> and having length "
"I<length> is updated."

"According to POSIX, either B<MS_SYNC> or B<MS_ASYNC> must be specified in "
"I<flags>, and indeed failure to include one of these flags will cause "
"B<msync>()  to fail on some systems.  However, Linux permits a call to "
"B<msync>()  that specifies neither of these flags, with semantics that are "
"(currently) equivalent to specifying B<MS_ASYNC>.  (Since Linux 2.6.19, "
"B<MS_ASYNC> is in fact a no-op, since the kernel properly tracks dirty pages "
"and flushes them to storage as necessary.)  Notwithstanding the Linux "
"behavior, portable, future-proof applications should ensure that they "
