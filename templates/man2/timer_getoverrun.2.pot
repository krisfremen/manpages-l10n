msgid ""
"B<timer_getoverrun>()  returns the \"overrun count\" for the timer referred "
"to by I<timerid>.  An application can use the overrun count to accurately "
"calculate the number of timer expirations that would have occurred over a "
"given time interval.  Timer overruns can occur both when receiving "
"expiration notifications via signals (B<SIGEV_SIGNAL>), and via threads "
"(B<SIGEV_THREAD>)."

msgid ""
"When expiration notifications are delivered via a signal, overruns can occur "
"as follows.  Regardless of whether or not a real-time signal is used for "
"timer notifications, the system queues at most one signal per timer.  (This "
"is the behavior specified by POSIX.1.  The alternative, queuing one signal "
"for each timer expiration, could easily result in overflowing the allowed "
"limits for queued signals on the system.)  Because of system scheduling "
"delays, or because the signal may be temporarily blocked, there can be a "
"delay between the time when the notification signal is generated and the "
"time when it is delivered (e.g., caught by a signal handler) or accepted (e."
"g., using B<sigwaitinfo>(2)).  In this interval, further timer expirations "
"may occur.  The timer overrun count is the number of additional timer "
"expirations that occurred between the time when the signal was generated and "
"when it was delivered or accepted."

"Timer overruns can also occur when expiration notifications are delivered "
"via invocation of a thread, since there may be an arbitrary delay between an "
"expiration of the timer and the invocation of the notification thread, and "

"When timer notifications are delivered via signals (B<SIGEV_SIGNAL>), on "
"Linux it is also possible to obtain the overrun count via the I<si_overrun> "
"field of the I<siginfo_t> structure (see B<sigaction>(2)).  This allows an "
"application to avoid the overhead of making a system call to obtain the "
"overrun count, but is a nonportable extension to POSIX.1."
