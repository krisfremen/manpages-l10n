"B<ipc>()  is a common kernel entry point for the System\\ V IPC calls for "
"messages, semaphores, and shared memory.  I<call> determines which IPC "
"function to invoke; the other arguments are passed through to the "
"appropriate call."

"User-space programs should call the appropriate functions by their usual "
"names.  Only standard library implementors and kernel hackers need to know "
