"From glibc version 2.3.4 up to and including version 2.24, the glibc wrapper "
"function for B<getpid>()  cached PIDs, with the goal of avoiding additional "
"system calls when a process calls B<getpid>()  repeatedly.  Normally this "
"caching was invisible, but its correct operation relied on support in the "
"wrapper functions for B<fork>(2), B<vfork>(2), and B<clone>(2): if an "
"application bypassed the glibc wrappers for these system calls by using "
"B<syscall>(2), then a call to B<getpid>()  in the child would return the "
"wrong value (to be precise: it would return the PID of the parent process).  "
"In addition, there were cases where B<getpid>()  could return the wrong "
"value even when invoking B<clone>(2)  via the glibc wrapper function.  (For "
"a discussion of one such case, see BUGS in B<clone>(2).)  Furthermore, the "
"complexity of the caching code had been the source of a few bugs within "
"glibc over the years."
