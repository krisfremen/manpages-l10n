"B<pivot_root>()  moves the root filesystem of the calling process to the "
"directory I<put_old> and makes I<new_root> the new root filesystem of the "
"calling process."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-buster debian-unstable mageia-cauldron
msgid ""
"The typical use of B<pivot_root>()  is during system startup, when the "
"system mounts a temporary root filesystem (e.g., an B<initrd>), then mounts "
"the real root filesystem, and eventually turns the latter into the current "
"root of all relevant processes or threads."

msgid ""
"B<pivot_root>()  may or may not change the current root and the current "
"working directory of any processes or threads which use the old root "
"directory.  The caller of B<pivot_root>()  must ensure that processes with "
"root or current working directory at the old root operate correctly in "
"either case.  An easy way to ensure this is to change their root and current "
"working directory to I<new_root> before invoking B<pivot_root>()."

"The paragraph above is intentionally vague because the implementation of "
"B<pivot_root>()  may change in the future.  At the time of writing, "
"B<pivot_root>()  changes root and current working directory of each process "
"or thread to I<new_root> if they point to the old root directory.  This is "
"necessary in order to prevent kernel threads from keeping the old root "
"directory busy with their root and current working directory, even if they "
"never access the filesystem in any way.  In the future, there may be a "
"mechanism for kernel threads to explicitly relinquish any access to the "
"filesystem, such that this fairly intrusive mechanism can be removed from "
"B<pivot_root>()."
