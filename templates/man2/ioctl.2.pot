"The B<ioctl>()  system call manipulates the underlying device parameters of "
"special files.  In particular, many operating characteristics of character "
"special files (e.g., terminals) may be controlled with B<ioctl>()  "
"requests.  The argument I<fd> must be an open file descriptor."

"The second argument is a device-dependent request code.  The third argument "
"is an untyped pointer to memory.  It's traditionally B<char *>I<argp> (from "
"the days before B<void *> was valid C), and will be so named for this "
"discussion."
