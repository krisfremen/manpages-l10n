msgid ""
"On Linux, a process has both a filesystem group ID and an effective group "
"ID.  The (Linux-specific) filesystem group ID is used for permissions "
"checking when accessing filesystem objects, while the effective group ID is "
"used for some other kinds of permissions checks (see B<credentials>(7))."

msgid ""
"Normally, the value of the process's filesystem group ID is the same as the "
"value of its effective group ID.  This is so, because whenever a process's "
"effective group ID is changed, the kernel also changes the filesystem group "
"ID to be the same as the new value of the effective group ID.  A process can "
"cause the value of its filesystem group ID to diverge from its effective "
"group ID by using B<setfsgid>()  to change its filesystem group ID to the "
"value given in I<fsgid>."

msgid ""
"The filesystem group ID concept and the B<setfsgid>()  system call were "
"invented for historical reasons that are no longer applicable on modern "
"Linux kernels.  See B<setfsuid>(2)  for a discussion of why the use of both "
"B<setfsuid>(2)  and B<setfsgid>()  is nowadays unneeded."

"The original Linux B<setfsgid>()  system call supported only 16-bit group "
"IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added B<setfsgid32>()  supporting 32-bit IDs.  "
"The glibc B<setfsgid>()  wrapper function transparently deals with the "
"variation across kernel versions."

msgid ""
"No error indications of any kind are returned to the caller, and the fact "
"that both successful and unsuccessful calls return the same value makes it "
"impossible to directly determine whether the call succeeded or failed.  "
"Instead, the caller must resort to looking at the return value from a "
"further call such as I<setfsgid(-1)> (which will always fail), in order to "
"determine if a preceding call to B<setfsgid>()  changed the filesystem group "
"ID.  At the very least, B<EPERM> should be returned when the call fails "
"(because the caller lacks the B<CAP_SETGID> capability)."
