#.  commit 4307d1e5ada595c87f9a4d16db16ba5edb70dcb1
#.  Author: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
#.  Date:   Wed Nov 7 18:37:48 2007 +0100
#.  x86: ignore the sys_getcpu() tcache parameter
#.  ===== Before kernel 2.6.24: =====
#.  .I tcache
#.  is a pointer to a
#.  .IR "struct getcpu_cache"
#.  that is used as a cache by
#.  .BR getcpu ().
#.  The caller should put the cache into a thread-local variable
#.  if the process is multithreaded,
#.  because the cache cannot be shared between different threads.
#.  .I tcache
#.  can be NULL.
#.  If it is not NULL
#.  .BR getcpu ()
#.  will use it to speed up operation.
#.  The information inside the cache is private to the system call
#.  and should not be accessed by the user program.
#.  The information placed in the cache can change between kernel releases.
#.  When no cache is specified
#.  .BR getcpu ()
#.  will be slower,
#.  but always retrieve the current CPU and node information.
#.  With a cache
#.  .BR getcpu ()
#.  is faster.
#.  However, the cached information is updated only once per jiffy (see
#.  .BR time (7)).
#.  This means that the information could theoretically be out of date,
#.  although in practice the scheduler's attempt to maintain
#.  soft CPU affinity means that the information is unlikely to change
#.  over the course of the caching interval.

"The I<tcache> argument is unused since Linux 2.6.24.  In earlier kernels, if "
"this argument was non-NULL, then it specified a pointer to a caller-"
"allocated buffer in thread-local storage that was used to provide a caching "
"mechanism for B<getcpu>().  Use of the cache could speed B<getcpu>()  calls, "
"at the cost that there was a very small chance that the returned information "
"would be out of date.  The caching mechanism was considered to cause "
"problems when migrating threads between CPUs, and so the argument is now "
"ignored."
