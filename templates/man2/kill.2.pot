"Across different kernel versions, Linux has enforced different rules for the "
"permissions required for an unprivileged process to send a signal to another "
"process.  In kernels 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent if the effective "
"user ID of the sender matched effective user ID of the target, or the real "
"user ID of the sender matched the real user ID of the target.  From kernel "
"1.2.3 until 1.3.77, a signal could be sent if the effective user ID of the "
"sender matched either the real or effective user ID of the target.  The "
"current rules, which conform to POSIX.1, were adopted in kernel 1.3.78."
