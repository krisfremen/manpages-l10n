.SH NAME
thinkjettopbm \- convert HP ThinkJet printer commands file to PBM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B thinkjettopbm
.RI [ -d ]
.RI [ thinkjet_file ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads HP ThinkJet printer commands from the standard input, or
.I thinkjet_file
if specified, and writes a PBM image
to the standard output.
Text and non-graphics command sequences are silently ignored.

The
.B -d
option turns on debugging messages which are written to the standard error stream.

.SH BUGS
Handles only a small subset of ThinkJet command sequences, but enough to convert
screen images from older HP test equipment.
