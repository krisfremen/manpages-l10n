.TH ppmtv 1 "16 November 1993"
.IX ppmtv
.SH NAME
ppmtv - make a portable pixmap look like taken from an American TV
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmtv
.I dimfactor
.RI [ ppmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input. Dims every other row of image data
down by the specified dim factor. This factor may be in the range of
0.0 (the alternate lines are totally black) to 1.0 (original image).
.PP
This creates an effect similar to what I've once seen in the video 
clip 'You could be mine' by Guns'n'Roses. In the scene I'm talking about you 
can see John Connor on his motorbike, looking up from the water trench (?) 
he's standing in. While the camera pulls back, the image gets 'normal' by 
brightening up the alternate rows of it. I thought this would be an 
interesting effect to try in MPEG. I did not yet check this out, however. 
Try for yourself.
