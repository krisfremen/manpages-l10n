.TH ppmflash 1 "16 November 1993"
.IX ppmflash
.SH NAME
ppmflash - brighten a picture up to complete white-out
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmflash 
.I flashfactor 
.RI [ ppmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input. Increases its brightness by
the specified flashfactor up to a total white-out image.
The flashfactor may be in the range from 0.0 (original picture's
brightness) to 1.0 (full white-out, The Second After).
.PP
As
.I pnmgamma
does not do the brightness correction in the way I
wanted it, this small program was written.
.PP
This program is similar to
.I ppmbrighten
, but not exactly the same.
.SH SEE ALSO
