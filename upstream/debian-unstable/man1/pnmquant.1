.IX pnmquant
.SH NAME
pnmquant - quantize the colors in a Netpbm image to a smaller set

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pnmquant
.RB [ -center | -meancolor | -meanpixel ]
.RB [ -floyd | -fs ]
.RB [ -nofloyd | -nofs ]
.RB [ -spreadbrightness | -spreadluminosity ]
.I ncolors
.RI [ pnmfile ]
.fi

All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may
use either white space or equals signs between an option name and its
value.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a PNM image as input.  Chooses
.I ncolors
colors to best represent the image, maps the existing colors
to the new ones, and writes a PNM image as output.
.IX "colormap reduction"

This program is simply a combination of 
.B pnmcolormap
and 
.BR pnmremap ,
where the colors of the input are remapped using a color map which is
generated from the colors in that same input.  The options have the
same meaning as in those programs.  See their documentation to
understand
.BR pnmquant .

It is much faster to call 
.B pnmcolormap
and
.B pnmremap
directly than to run 
.BR pnmquant .
.B pnmquant
is just a convenience.

.B ppmquant
is an older program which does the same thing as 
.BR pnmquant ,
but on only PPM images.  It is, however, faster than either
.B pnmquant
or
.BR ppmcolormap / pnmremap .
