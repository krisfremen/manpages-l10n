.SH "NAME"
systemd.network \- Network configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetwork\fR\&.network
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Network setup is performed by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&.
.PP
The main network file must have the extension
\&.network; other extensions are ignored\&. Networks are applied to links whenever the links appear\&.
.PP
The
\&.network
files are read from the files located in the system network directories
/lib/systemd/network
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc
have the highest priority, files in
/run
take precedence over files with the same name under
/usr\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.
.PP
Along with the network file
foo\&.network, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.network\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be parsed after the file itself is parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc
take precedence over those in
/run
which in turn take precedence over those in
/lib\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main network file wherever located\&.
.PP
Note that an interface without any static IPv6 addresses configured, and neither DHCPv6 nor IPv6LL enabled, shall be considered to have no IPv6 support\&. IPv6 will be automatically disabled for that interface by writing "1" to
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/\fIifname\fR/disable_ipv6\&.
.SH "[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The network file contains a
"[Match]"
section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a given device; and a
"[Network]"
section specifying how the device should be configured\&. The first (in lexical order) of the network files that matches a given device is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well\&.
.PP
A network file is said to match a network interface if all matches specified by the
"[Match]"
section are satisfied\&. When a network file does not contain valid settings in
"[Match]"
section, then the file will match all interfaces and
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
warns about that\&. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it clear that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:

.RE
.SH "[LINK] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The
"[Link]"
section accepts the following keys:
.PP
\fIMACAddress=\fR
.RS 4
The hardware address to set for the device\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMTUBytes=\fR
.RS 4
The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device\&. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported and are understood to the base of 1024\&.
.sp
Note that if IPv6 is enabled on the interface, and the MTU is chosen below 1280 (the minimum MTU for IPv6) it will automatically be increased to this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIARP=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the ARP (low\-level Address Resolution Protocol) for this interface is enabled\&. When unset, the kernel\*(Aqs default will be used\&.
.sp
For example, disabling ARP is useful when creating multiple MACVLAN or VLAN virtual interfaces atop a single lower\-level physical interface, which will then only serve as a link/"bridge" device aggregating traffic to the same physical link and not participate in the network otherwise\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMulticast=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the multicast flag on the device is enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIAllMulticast=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the driver retrieves all multicast packets from the network\&. This happens when multicast routing is enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIUnmanaged=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. When
"yes", no attempts are made to bring up or configure matching links, equivalent to when there are no matching network files\&. Defaults to
"no"\&.
.sp
This is useful for preventing later matching network files from interfering with certain interfaces that are fully controlled by other applications\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRequiredForOnline=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean or operational state\&. Please see
\fBnetworkctl\fR(1)
for possible operational states\&. When
"yes", the network is deemed required when determining whether the system is online when running
\fBsystemd\-networkd\-wait\-online\fR\&. When
"no", the network is ignored when checking for online state\&. When an operational state is set,
"yes"
is implied, and this controls the operational state required for the network interface to be considered online\&. Defaults to
"yes"\&.
.sp
The network will be brought up normally in all cases, but in the event that there is no address being assigned by DHCP or the cable is not plugged in, the link will simply remain offline and be skipped automatically by
\fBsystemd\-networkd\-wait\-online\fR
if
"RequiredForOnline=no"\&.
.RE

\fIDHCP=\fR
.RS 4
Enables DHCPv4 and/or DHCPv6 client support\&. Accepts
"yes",
"no",
"ipv4", or
"ipv6"\&. Defaults to
"no"\&.
.sp
Note that DHCPv6 will by default be triggered by Router Advertisement, if that is enabled, regardless of this parameter\&. By enabling DHCPv6 support explicitly, the DHCPv6 client will be started regardless of the presence of routers on the link, or what flags the routers pass\&. See
"IPv6AcceptRA="\&.
.sp
Furthermore, note that by default the domain name specified through DHCP is not used for name resolution\&. See option
\fBUseDomains=\fR

\fILinkLocalAddressing=\fR
.RS 4
Enables link\-local address autoconfiguration\&. Accepts
"yes",
"no",
"ipv4",
"ipv6",
"fallback", or
"ipv4\-fallback"\&. If
"fallback"
or
"ipv4\-fallback"
is specified, then an IPv4 link\-local address is configured only when DHCPv4 fails\&. If
"fallback", an IPv6 link\-local address is always configured, and if
"ipv4\-fallback", the address is not configured\&. Note that, the fallback mechanism works only when DHCPv4 client is enabled, that is, it requires
"DHCP=yes"
or
"DHCP=ipv4"\&. If
\fIBridge=\fR

\fILLDP=\fR
.RS 4
Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet reception\&. LLDP is a link\-layer protocol commonly implemented on professional routers and bridges which announces which physical port a system is connected to, as well as other related data\&. Accepts a boolean or the special value
"routers\-only"\&. When true, incoming LLDP packets are accepted and a database of all LLDP neighbors maintained\&. If
"routers\-only"
is set only LLDP data of various types of routers is collected and LLDP data about other types of devices ignored (such as stations, telephones and others)\&. If false, LLDP reception is disabled\&. Defaults to
"routers\-only"\&. Use
\fBnetworkctl\fR(1)
to query the collected neighbor data\&. LLDP is only available on Ethernet links\&. See
\fIEmitLLDP=\fR
below for enabling LLDP packet emission from the local system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIEmitLLDP=\fR
.RS 4
Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission\&. Accepts a boolean parameter or the special values
"nearest\-bridge",
"non\-tpmr\-bridge"
and
"customer\-bridge"\&. Defaults to false, which turns off LLDP packet emission\&. If not false, a short LLDP packet with information about the local system is sent out in regular intervals on the link\&. The LLDP packet will contain information about the local host name, the local machine ID (as stored in
\fBmachine-id\fR(5)) and the local interface name, as well as the pretty hostname of the system (as set in
\fBmachine-info\fR(5))\&. LLDP emission is only available on Ethernet links\&. Note that this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be made available\&. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which interfaces they are connected to this system\&. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets\&. The
"nearest\-bridge"
setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge,
"non\-tpmr\-bridge"
permits propagation across Two\-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and
"customer\-bridge"
permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached\&. For details about these concepts, see
\m[blue]\fBIEEE 802\&.1AB\-2016\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2\&. Note that configuring this setting to true is equivalent to
"nearest\-bridge", the recommended and most restricted level of propagation\&. See
\fILLDP=\fR
above for an option to enable LLDP reception\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIBindCarrier=\fR
.RS 4
A link name or a list of link names\&. When set, controls the behavior of the current link\&. When all links in the list are in an operational down state, the current link is brought down\&. When at least one link has carrier, the current interface is brought up\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIAddress=\fR
.RS 4
A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a
"/"
character\&. Specify this key more than once to configure several addresses\&. The format of the address must be as described in
\fBinet_pton\fR(3)\&. This is a short\-hand for an [Address] section only containing an Address key (see below)\&. This option may be specified more than once\&.
.sp
If the specified address is
"0\&.0\&.0\&.0"
(for IPv4) or
"::"
(for IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is automatically allocated from a system\-wide pool of unused ranges\&. Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and 64 for IPv6\&. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration files to avoid address range conflicts\&. The default system\-wide pool consists of 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16, 172\&.16\&.0\&.0/12 and 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6\&. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of dynamically created network interfaces with the same network configuration and automatic address range assignment\&.

\fIDomains=\fR
.RS 4
A list of domains which should be resolved using the DNS servers on this link\&. Each item in the list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ("~")\&. The domains with the prefix are called "routing\-only domains"\&. The domains without the prefix are called "search domains" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single\-label host names (host names containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)\&. If a single\-label host name is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved\&.
.sp
Both "search" and "routing\-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look\-ups for host names ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface\&. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi\-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface\&.
.sp
The "routing\-only" domain
"~\&."
(the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect\&. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface\&. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available\&.
.sp
This setting is read by
\fBsystemd-resolved.service\fR(8)\&. "Search domains" correspond to the
\fIdomain\fR

\fB2\fR\&.
.sp
Note that kernel\*(Aqs implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is always disabled, regardless of this setting\&. If this option is enabled, a userspace implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is used, and the kernel\*(Aqs own implementation remains disabled, since
