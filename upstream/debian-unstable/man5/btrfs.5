.SH "MOUNT OPTIONS"

.sp
This section describes mount options specific to BTRFS\&. For the generic mount options please refer to \fBmount\fR(8) manpage\&. The options are sorted alphabetically (discarding the \fIno\fR prefix)\&.

.sp
most mount options apply to the whole filesystem and only options in the first mounted subvolume will take effect\&. This is due to lack of implementation and may change in the future\&. This means that (for example) you can\(cqt set per\-subvolume \fInodatacow\fR, \fInodatasum\fR, or \fIcompress\fR using mount options\&. This should eventually be fixed, but it has proved to be difficult to implement correctly within the Linux VFS framework\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
Mount options are processed in order, only the last occurrence of an option takes effect and may disable other options due to constraints (see eg\&. \fInodatacow\fR and \fIcompress\fR)\&. The output of \fImount\fR command shows which options have been applied\&.

.sp

Enable/disable support for Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs)\&. See the
\fBacl\fR(5) manual page for more information about ACLs\&.
.sp

The support for ACL is build\-time configurable (BTRFS_FS_POSIX_ACL) and mount fails if
\fIacl\fR

Enable automatic file defragmentation\&. When enabled, small random writes into files (in a range of tens of kilobytes, currently it\(cqs 64K) are detected and queued up for the defragmentation process\&. Not well suited for large database workloads\&.
.sp

The read latency may increase due to reading the adjacent blocks that make up the range for defragmentation, successive write will merge the blocks in the new location\&.

.PP
\fBbarrier\fR, \fBnobarrier\fR
.RS 4




(default: on)
.sp

Ensure that all IO write operations make it through the device cache and are stored permanently when the filesystem is at its consistency checkpoint\&. This typically means that a flush command is sent to the device that will synchronize all pending data and ordinary metadata blocks, then writes the superblock and issues another flush\&.
.sp

The write flushes incur a slight hit and also prevent the IO block scheduler to reorder requests in a more effective way\&. Disabling barriers gets rid of that penalty but will most certainly lead to a corrupted filesystem in case of a crash or power loss\&. The ordinary metadata blocks could be yet unwritten at the time the new superblock is stored permanently, expecting that the block pointers to metadata were stored permanently before\&.
.sp

On a device with a volatile battery\-backed write\-back cache, the
\fInobarrier\fR
option will not lead to filesystem corruption as the pending blocks are supposed to make it to the permanent storage\&.

(since: 3\&.0, default: off)
.sp

These debugging options control the behavior of the integrity checking module (the BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY config option required)\&. The main goal is to verify that all blocks from a given transaction period are properly linked\&.
.sp

\fIcheck_int\fR
enables the integrity checker module, which examines all block write requests to ensure on\-disk consistency, at a large memory and CPU cost\&.
.sp

\fIcheck_int_data\fR
includes extent data in the integrity checks, and implies the
\fIcheck_int\fR
option\&.
.sp

\fIcheck_int_print_mask\fR
takes a bitmask of BTRFSIC_PRINT_MASK_* values as defined in
\fIfs/btrfs/check\-integrity\&.c\fR, to control the integrity checker module behavior\&.
.sp

See comments at the top of
\fIfs/btrfs/check\-integrity\&.c\fR
for more information\&.

Force clearing and rebuilding of the disk space cache if something has gone wrong\&. See also:
\fIspace_cache\fR\&.

.RE

\fBcommit=\fR\fB\fIseconds\fR\fR
.RS 4



(since: 3\&.12, default: 30)
.sp

Set the interval of periodic transaction commit when data are synchronized to permanent storage\&. Higher interval values lead to larger amount of unwritten data, which has obvious consequences when the system crashes\&. The upper bound is not forced, but a warning is printed if it\(cqs more than 300 seconds (5 minutes)\&. Use with care\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBcompress\fR, \fBcompress=\fR\fB\fItype[:level]\fR\fR, \fBcompress\-force\fR, \fBcompress\-force=\fR\fB\fItype[:level]\fR\fR
.RS 4






(default: off, level support since: 5\&.1)
.sp

Control BTRFS file data compression\&. Type may be specified as
\fIzlib\fR,
\fIlzo\fR,
\fIzstd\fR
or
\fIno\fR
(for no compression, used for remounting)\&. If no type is specified,
\fIzlib\fR
is used\&. If
\fIcompress\-force\fR
is specified, then compression will always be attempted, but the data may end up uncompressed if the compression would make them larger\&.
.sp

Both
\fIzlib\fR
and
\fIzstd\fR
(since version 5\&.1) expose the compression level as a tunable knob with higher levels trading speed and memory (\fIzstd\fR) for higher compression ratios\&. This can be set by appending a colon and the desired level\&. Zlib accepts the range [1, 9] and zstd accepts [1, 15]\&. If no level is set, both currently use a default level of 3\&. The value 0 is an alias for the default level\&.
.sp

Otherwise some simple heuristics are applied to detect an incompressible file\&. If the first blocks written to a file are not compressible, the whole file is permanently marked to skip compression\&. As this is too simple, the
\fIcompress\-force\fR
is a workaround that will compress most of the files at the cost of some wasted CPU cycles on failed attempts\&. Since kernel 4\&.15, a set of heuristic algorithms have been improved by using frequency sampling, repeated pattern detection and Shannon entropy calculation to avoid that\&.

There is a slight performance gain when checksums are turned off, the corresponding metadata blocks holding the checksums do not need to updated\&. The cost of checksumming of the blocks in memory is much lower than the IO, modern CPUs feature hardware support of the checksumming algorithm\&.

.RE

\fBdegraded\fR
.RS 4



(default: off)
.sp

Allow mounts with less devices than the RAID profile constraints require\&. A read\-write mount (or remount) may fail when there are too many devices missing, for example if a stripe member is completely missing from RAID0\&.
.sp

Since 4\&.14, the constraint checks have been improved and are verified on the chunk level, not an the device level\&. This allows degraded mounts of filesystems with mixed RAID profiles for data and metadata, even if the device number constraints would not be satisfied for some of the profiles\&.
.sp

Example: metadata \(em raid1, data \(em single, devices \(em /dev/sda, /dev/sdb
.sp

Suppose the data are completely stored on
\fIsda\fR, then missing
\fIsdb\fR
will not prevent the mount, even if 1 missing device would normally prevent (any)
\fIsingle\fR
profile to mount\&. In case some of the data chunks are stored on
\fIsdb\fR, then the constraint of single/data is not satisfied and the filesystem cannot be mounted\&.

\fBdiscard\fR, \fBdiscard=sync\fR, \fBdiscard=async\fR, \fBnodiscard\fR
.RS 4






(default: off, async support since: 5\&.6)
.sp

Enable discarding of freed file blocks\&. This is useful for SSD devices, thinly provisioned LUNs, or virtual machine images; however, every storage layer must support discard for it to work\&.
.sp

In the synchronous mode (\fIsync\fR
or without option value), lack of asynchronous queued TRIM on the backing device TRIM can severely degrade performance, because a synchronous TRIM operation will be attempted instead\&. Queued TRIM requires newer than SATA revision 3\&.1 chipsets and devices\&.
.sp

The asynchronous mode (\fIasync\fR) gathers extents in larger chunks before sending them to the devices for TRIM\&. The overhead and performance impact should be negligible compared to the previous mode and it\(cqs supposed to be the preferred mode if needed\&.
.sp

If it is not necessary to immediately discard freed blocks, then the
\fBfstrim\fR
tool can be used to discard all free blocks in a batch\&. Scheduling a TRIM during a period of low system activity will prevent latent interference with the performance of other operations\&. Also, a device may ignore the TRIM command if the range is too small, so running a batch discard has a greater probability of actually discarding the blocks\&.

This option forces any data dirtied by a write in a prior transaction to commit as part of the current commit, effectively a full filesystem sync\&.
.sp

This makes the committed state a fully consistent view of the file system from the application\(cqs perspective (i\&.e\&. it includes all completed file system operations)\&. This was previously the behavior only when a snapshot was created\&.

When off, the filesystem is consistent but buffered writes may last more than one transaction commit\&.

Enable free inode number caching\&. Not recommended to use unless files on your filesystem get assigned inode numbers that are approaching 264\&. Normally, new files in each subvolume get assigned incrementally (plus one from the last time) and are not reused\&. The mount option turns on caching of the existing inode numbers and reuse of inode numbers of deleted files\&.

.sp .5v

Don\(cqt use this option unless you really need it\&. The inode number limit on 64bit system is 264, which is practically enough for the whole filesystem lifetime\&. Due to implementation of linux VFS layer, the inode numbers on 32bit systems are only 32 bits wide\&. This lowers the limit significantly and makes it possible to reach it\&. In such case, this mount option will help\&. Alternatively, files with high inode numbers can be copied to a new subvolume which will effectively start the inode numbers from the beginning again\&.

.sp

Options to control the free space cache\&. The free space cache greatly improves performance when reading block group free space into memory\&. However, managing the space cache consumes some resources, including a small amount of disk space\&.
.sp

There are two implementations of the free space cache\&. The original one, referred to as
\fIv1\fR, is the safe default\&. The
\fIv1\fR
space cache can be disabled at mount time with
\fInospace_cache\fR
without clearing\&.
.sp

On very large filesystems (many terabytes) and certain workloads, the performance of the
\fIv1\fR
space cache may degrade drastically\&. The
\fIv2\fR
implementation, which adds a new B\-tree called the free space tree, addresses this issue\&. Once enabled, the
\fIv2\fR
space cache will always be used and cannot be disabled unless it is cleared\&. Use
\fIclear_cache,space_cache=v1\fR
or
\fIclear_cache,nospace_cache\fR
to do so\&. If
\fIv2\fR
is enabled, kernels without
\fIv2\fR
support will only be able to mount the filesystem in read\-only mode\&. The
\fBbtrfs\fR(8) command currently only has read\-only support for
\fIv2\fR\&. A read\-write command may be run on a
\fIv2\fR
filesystem by clearing the cache, running the command, and then remounting with
\fIspace_cache=v2\fR\&.

If a version is not explicitly specified, the default implementation will be chosen, which is

The device is usually created by a system device node manager (eg\&. udev), but can be created manually:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# mknod \-\-mode=600 /dev/btrfs\-control c 10 234
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
The control device is not strictly required but the device scanning will not work and a workaround would need to be used to mount a multi\-device filesystem\&. The mount option \fIdevice\fR can trigger the device scanning during mount\&.

.SH "FILESYSTEM WITH MULTIPLE PROFILES"

.sp
It is possible that a btrfs filesystem contains multiple block group profiles of the same type\&. This could happen when a profile conversion using balance filters is interrupted (see \fBbtrfs\-balance\fR(8))\&. Some \fIbtrfs\fR commands perform a test to detect this kind of condition and print a warning like this:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
WARNING: Multiple block group profiles detected, see \*(Aqman btrfs(5)\*(Aq\&.
WARNING:   Data: single, raid1
WARNING:   Metadata: single, raid1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The corresponding output of \fBbtrfs filesystem df\fR might look like:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
WARNING: Multiple block group profiles detected, see \*(Aqman btrfs(5)\*(Aq\&.
WARNING:   Data: single, raid1

.sp
This state of the filesystem OK but most likely needs the user/administrator to take an action and finish the interrupted tasks\&. This cannot be easily done automatically, also the user knows the expected final profiles\&.
.sp
In the example above, the filesystem started as a single device and \fIsingle\fR block group profile\&. Then another device was added, followed by balance with \fIconvert=raid1\fR but for some reason hasn\(cqt finished\&. Restarting the balance with \fIconvert=raid1\fR will continue and end up with filesystem with all block group profiles \fIRAID1\fR\&.

If you\(cqre familiar with balance filters, you can use \fIconvert=raid1,profiles=single,soft\fR, which will take only the unconverted \fIsingle\fR profiles and convert them to \fIraid1\fR\&. This may speed up the conversion as it would not try to rewrite the already convert \fIraid1\fR profiles\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
Having just one profile is desired as this also clearly defines the profile of newly allocated block groups, otherwise this depends on internal allocation policy\&. When there are multiple profiles present, the order of selection is RAID6, RAID5, RAID10, RAID1, RAID0 as long as the device number constraints are satisfied\&.
.sp
Commands that print the warning were chosen so they\(cqre brought to user attention when the filesystem state is being changed in that regard\&. This is: \fIdevice add\fR, \fIdevice delete\fR, \fIbalance cancel\fR, \fIbalance pause\fR\&. Commands that report space usage: \fIfilesystem df\fR, \fIdevice usage\fR\&. The command \fIfilesystem usage\fR provides a line in the overall summary:
