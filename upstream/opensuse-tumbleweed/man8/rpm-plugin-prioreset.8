.SH NAME
.PP
rpm-plugin-prioreset - Plugin for the RPM Package Manager to fix issues
with priorities of deamons on SysV init
.SH Description
.PP
In general scriptlets run with the same priority as rpm itself.
However on legacy SysV init systems, properties of the parent process
can be inherited by the actual daemons on restart.
As a result daemons may end up with unwanted nice or ionice values.
This plugin resets the scriptlet process priorities after forking, and
can be used to counter that effect.
Should not be used with systemd because it\[aq]s not needed there, and
the effect is counter-productive.
.SH Configuration
.PP
