rpmspec - RPM Spec Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS QUERYING SPEC FILES:
.PP
\f[B]rpmspec\f[R] {\f[B]-q|--query\f[R]} [\f[B]select-options\f[R]]
[\f[B]query-options\f[R]] \f[I]SPEC_FILE ...\f[R]
.SS PARSING SPEC FILES TO STDOUT:
.PP
\f[B]rpmspec\f[R] {\f[B]-P|--parse\f[R]} \f[I]SPEC_FILE ...\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]rpmspec\f[R] is a tool for querying a spec file.
More specifically for querying hypothetical packages which would be
created from the given spec file.
So querying a spec file with \f[B]rpmspec\f[R] is similar to querying a
package built from that spec file.
But is is not identical.
With \f[B]rpmspec\f[R] you can\[aq]t query all fields which you can
query from a built package.
E.
g.
you can\[aq]t query BUILDTIME with \f[B]rpmspec\f[R] for obvious
reasons.
You also cannot query other fields automatically generated during a
build of a package like auto generated dependencies.

.SS QUERY OPTIONS
.PP
The general form of an rpm spec query command is
.PP
\f[B]rpm\f[R] {\f[B]-q|--query\f[R]} [\f[B]select-options\f[R]]
[\f[B]query-options\f[R]]
.PP
You may specify the format that the information should be printed in.
To do this, you use the
.PP
\f[B]--qf|--queryformat\f[R] \f[I]QUERYFMT\f[R]
.PP
option, followed by the \f[I]QUERYFMT\f[R] format string.
See \f[B]rpm(8)\f[R] for details.
.SS SELECT OPTIONS
.PP
\f[B]--rpms\f[R] Operate on the all binary package headers generated
from spec.
\f[B]--builtrpms\f[R] Operate only on the binary package headers of
packages which would be built from spec.
That means ignoring package headers of packages that won\[aq]t be built
from spec i.
e.
ignoring package headers of packages without file section.
\f[B]--srpm\f[R] Operate on the source package header(s) generated from
spec.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Get list of binary packages which would be generated from the rpm spec
file:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 $ rpmspec -q rpm.spec
 rpm-4.11.3-3.fc20.x86_64
 rpm-libs-4.11.3-3.fc20.x86_64
 rpm-build-libs-4.11.3-3.fc20.x86_64
 ...

Get summary infos for single binary packages generated from the rpm spec file:

 $ rpmspec -q --qf \[dq]%{name}: %{summary}\[rs]n\[dq] rpm.spec
 rpm: The RPM package management system
 rpm-libs: Libraries for manipulating RPM packages
 rpm-build-libs: Libraries for building and signing RPM packages
 ...

Get the source package which would be generated from the rpm spec file:

 $ rpmspec -q --srpm rpm.spec
 rpm-4.11.3-3.fc20.x86_64

Parse the rpm spec file to stdout:

 $ rpmspec -P rpm.spec

\f[B]rpmspec --help\f[R] - as rpm supports customizing the options via
popt aliases it\[aq]s impossible to guarantee that what\[aq]s described
in the manual matches what\[aq]s available.
