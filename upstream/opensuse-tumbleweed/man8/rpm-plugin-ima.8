.SH NAME
.PP
rpm-plugin-ima - IMA plugin for the RPM Package Manager
.SH Description
.PP
Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) and the Linux Extended
Verification Module (EVM) allow to detect when files have been
accidentally or maliciously altered.
This plugin puts IMA/EVM signatures in the \f[I]security.ima\f[R]
extended file attribute during installation.
This requires packages to contain the signatures - typically by being
signed with \f[B]rpmsign --signfiles\f[R].
.SH Configuration
.PP
The \f[I]%_ima_sign_config_files\f[R] macro controls whether signatures
should also be written for config files.
.PP
See \f[B]rpm-plugins\f[R](8) on how to control plugins in general.
