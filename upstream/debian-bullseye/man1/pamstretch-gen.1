.SH NAME
pamstretch-gen \- use pamstretch and pnmscale to scale by non-integer values

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pamstretch-gen
.I N
.RI [ pnmfile ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pamstretch-gen 
is a program which uses
.BR pamstretch (1),
.BR pnmfile (1),
and
.BR pnmscale (1)
to smoothly scale up a PNM file by any ratio; it's like a more general
version of pamstretch (hence the name). But other than the `any ratio'
bit, it's much the same as pamstretch. :-)

.SH BUGS
Uses awk just to make some simple floating-point calculations, which
is probably overkill. But using dc makes my head hurt.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR pamstretch (1),
.BR pnmscale (1)
