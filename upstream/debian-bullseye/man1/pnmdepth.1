.TH pnmdepth 1 "08 April 2000"
.IX pnmdepth
.SH NAME
pnmdepth - change the maxval in a portable anymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pnmdepth
.I newmaxval
.RI [ pnmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable anymap as input.
Scales all the pixel values, and writes out the image with the new maxval.
Scaling the colors down to a smaller maxval will result in some loss
of information.
.PP
Be careful of off-by-one errors when choosing the new maxval.
For instance, if you want the color values to be five bits wide,
use a maxval of 31, not 32.
.PP
One important use of 
.B pnmdepth
is to convert a new format 2-byte-per-sample PNM file to the older
1-byte-per-sample format.  Before April 2000, essentially all raw
(binary) format PNM files had a maxval less than 256 and one byte per
sample, and many programs may rely on that.  If you specify a
.I newmaxval
less than 256, the resulting file should be readable by any program
that worked with PNM files before April 2000.
