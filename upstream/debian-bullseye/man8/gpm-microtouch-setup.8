gpm-microtouch-setup \- Calibration program for Microtouch screens

.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the \fBgpm-microtouch-setup\fR command.
.PP
This program calibrates Microtouch screens for use with \fBgpm\fR(8).
.PP
The \fBgpm\fR(8) daemon must already be running in order to run the
program to work flawlessly, as the program stops and restarts \fBgpm\fR(8)
internally (it depends on \fBgpm\fR(8) for correct serial port
initialization). \fBmicrotouch-setup\fR uses \fI/dev/mouse\fR to access the
serial port, so \fI/dev/mouse\fR should point to a "ttyS" device.
