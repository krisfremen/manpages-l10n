.TH qmail-verify 8 "Andrew Richards" "28th August 2009" "v1.32"
.SH NAME
qmail-verify \- Address verification daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-verify
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-verify
receives UDP packets containing local email addresses and returns a
single byte to indicate if the address is valid or invalid to the
sender of the UDP packet.
.B qmail-smtpd
or
.B qmail-qmtpd
are typical clients using the
.B qmail-verify
service, although at present only
.B qmail-smtpd
has had this functionality added.
.B qmail-verify
is based on Paul Jarc's
.B realrcptto
patch for qmail
.I (http://code.dogmap.org/qmail/).

.B qmail-verify
uses the files
.I control/locals, control/virtualdomains, users/cdb,
the system password file entries (typically in
.B /etc/passwd
) as well as the existence or not of users' home directories and
.B .qmail[-xxx]
files to determine if a given address is valid.

Where a qmail system uses
.B .qmail-default
files on a per-domain basis in a virtual domains setup, this is
likely to result in all addresses being considered 'valid'. This
may not in fact be the case in certain situations, such as with
extensions/adaptations to qmail like vpopmail which use
.B .qmail-default
files throughout (delivery in this case is subsequently handled
by a vpopmail component). In these cases a replacement for
.B qmail-verify
will be required that can determine address validity.

Other customised qmail installations that use different methods
to locate users' mailboxes are likely to need alternatives to
.B qmail-verify
or a modified version of it for address verification.

.SH INVOCATION
.B qmail-verify
should be invoked as user
.I root
to have sufficient privileges to
determine the validity of a given address. In certain single-UID
virtual domains setups, it may be sufficient to run
.B qmail-verify
as the single-UID.

By default,
.B qmail-verify
listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 11113. This behaviour
can be changed by setting the environment variable
.B LISTEN
to specify the IP address and/or port: Set this to the desired
IP address, optionally followed by a colon and port, thus for
example LISTEN="192.168.1.1:10101".

.SH ADDRESS VERIFICATION DETAILS
.B qmail-verify
is implemented by taking the various pieces of qmail that parse an
address and combining them in the same executable,
.B qmail-verify.
Thus logic is taken from
.B qmail-send, qmail-lspawn, qmail-getpw
and
.B qmail-local.

.SH "UDP PACKET DETAILS"
The incoming packet contains just the email address to be checked
as a string. The string is optionally terminated with a 0 byte.

The response packet contains a single byte to indicate whether the
address is valid. The lowest-order bit of this byte indicates the
result:
.B 0
for 'valid',
.B 1
for 'invalid'. Other bits of this response byte are set by
.B qmail-verify
to give further debugging information; these other bits should
generally be disregarded.

Although not especially designed as a new protocol, extensions to
.B qmail-verify
could require the query string to be 0 terminated
to separate it from other data to follow. Currently the response packet
contains the response byte and the 'Controlling user'; more
information could potentially be returned if required.

.SH CONTROL FILES
At startup
.B qmail-verify
reads the following qmail control files:
.I control/envnoathost, control/locals, control/percenthack, control/virtualdomains.
If changes are made to any of these files,
.B qmail-verify
should be restarted for the changes to take effect in
.B qmail-verify.

If you are using different machines for
.B qmail-verify
and
.B qmail-smtpd
you should ensure that the machine providing the
.B qmail-verify
service has a full set of control files as well as the mailboxes; the machine
running
.B qmail-smtpd
still needs
.I control/rcpthosts
to be setup.

.SH LOGGING
.B qmail-verify
logs each decision it makes to stderr: The address followed by whether
it's valid or not.

.SH AUTHOR
Andrew Richards, building on the work of Paul Jarc and Dan Bernstein, and with
plenty of help along the way from Russell Nelson, John Levine and Charles Cazabon
amongst others.
