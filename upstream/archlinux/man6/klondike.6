.Nd Klondike solitaire card game
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Klondike is a card game with the object of sorting cards into four piles,
one for each suit, sorted by rank from Ace to King. The initial deal
creates seven sorting stacks; one card in the first to seven cards in
the last. The top card in each stack is revealed, while the rest stay
hidden.
.Pp
The game is played by moving the cards around the sorting stacks. You
may only move revealed cards in the sorting stacks, the last card dealt
from the deck, and the last card dealt onto the final sorted piles. You
may not move cards back into the deck. When you move a card, you must
move all the cards on top of it with it. In the sorting stacks you may
place a card only onto a card of one rank higher and a different suit
color. For example, a Jack of Spades can only be placed onto a Queen
of Hearts or Queen of Diamonds. In the final piles you may only place a
card that is one rank higher and of the same suit as the card already on
top. For example, if a final pile contains Ace-2-3-4 Clubs, then you may
only place 5 of Clubs on it.  The remaining cards in the deck are dealt
one at a time as needed. You may only move the last dealt card from the
dealt stack. When no cards remain in the deck, the dealt stack is turned
over and becomes the deck again.
.Pp
The game is won when the four final piles contain the all four suits in
Ace-King order.
