.Dt BATTLESTAR 6
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm battlestar
.Nd a tropical adventure game
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an adventure game in the classic style.
However, it's slightly less of a puzzle and more a game of exploration.
There are a few magical words in the game, but on the whole, simple English
should suffice to make one's desires understandable to the parser.
.Sh THE SETTING
In the days before the darkness came, when battlestars ruled the heavens...
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Three He made and gave them to His daughters,
Beautiful nymphs, the goddesses of the waters.
One to bring good luck and simple feats of wonder,
Two to wash the lands and churn the waves asunder,
Three to rule the world and purge the skies with thunder.
.Ed
.Pp
In those times great wizards were known and their powers were beyond belief.
They could take any object from thin air, and, uttering the word
.Sq su
could disappear.
.Pp
In those times men were known for their lust for gold and desire to
wear fine weapons. Swords and coats of mail were fashioned that could
withstand a laser blast.
.Pp
But when the darkness fell, the rightful reigns were toppled.
Swords and helms and heads of state went rolling across the grass.
The entire fleet of battlestars was reduced to a single ship.

Notice that the "shadow" of the next word stays around if you
want to take advantage of it.
That is, saying "take knife" and then "drop"
will drop the knife you just took.
.Sh SCORE \*[Am] INVEN
The two commands
.Dq score
and
.Dq inven
will print out your current status in the game.
.Sh SAVING A GAME
The command
.Dq save
will save your game in a file called
.Pa $HOME/.local/share/battlestar.save.
The saved game will be restored the next time you run battlestar.
.Sh DIRECTIONS
The compass directions N, S, E, and W can be used if you have a compass.
If you don't have a compass, you'll have to say R, L, A, or B, which
stand for Right, Left, Ahead, and Back. Directions printed in room
descriptions are always printed in R, L, A, and B relative directions.
.Sh HISTORY
I wrote Battlestar in 1979 in order to experiment with the niceties
of the C Language. Most interesting things that happen in the game
are hardwired into the code, so don't send me any hate mail about it!
Instead, enjoy art for art's sake!
