.Sh DESCRIPTION

Cribbage is a game for two players played with the standard 52 card deck.
Each game consists of a series of hands, each consisting of "the deal",
"the play", and "the show". The game is won by the first player to reach
the score of 61.
.Pp
The first dealer is chosen randomly. The dealer shuffles the deck and
deals six cards to each player. Each player then discards two cards face
down to form the "crib". The non-dealing player cuts the deck to reveal
the "starter". If this card is a Jack, the dealer scores 2 points for
"his heels".
.Pp
During "the play", each player plays a card in turn, stating the count
(the cumulative value of the cards laid down in this play). The value
of the numbered cards and Ace is at face value, while Jack, Queen, and
King are valued at 10. Points are scored for reaching multiples of 15,
for runs (valued by length), and for pairs (2), three-of-a-kind (6) and
four-of-a-kind (12). If a player cannot play without causing the count
exceed 31, he says "Go." The other player continues the play until he
is unable to play either. Once 31 is reached or no one can play, the
player who laid down the last card gets one point and another point if
the count is exactly 31. At this point the count is reset and another
round is played until players have no cards.
.Pp
In "the show" stage each player scores his hand based on its content in
conjunction with the starter card. Points are scored for combinations
of cards totalling 15, runs (valued at the size of the run), pairs,
a flush and having a Jack of the same suit as the starter card ("one
for his nob"). A four-card flush scores four and cannot include the cut
or starter. A five-card flush scores five. It is important to note
that each combination is scored separately. For example, the highest
possible hand is J,5,5,5 with the starter the 5 of the same suit as
the jack. There are four fifteens by combining the jack with a five,
four more by combinations of three fives (a total of 16 for fifteens);
the double pair royal adds 12 for a total of 28; and his nobs adds 1 for
a maximum score of 29. (the score of 2 for his heels does not count in
the total of the hand, since it is pegged before the play.)
.Pp
The dealer scores his hand last and then turns the cards in the crib
face up. These cards are then scored by the dealer as an additional hand,
also in conjunction with the starter card. Unlike the dealer's own hand,
the crib cannot score a four-card flush, but it can score a five-card
flush with the starter.
.Pp
The cribbage board is used for scoring, with two pegs inserted in
appropriate holes in leapfrog manner to keep the score for the current
and the previous hands. There are two rows of holes for each player,
used forward and back. In each game the pegs go twice around the board.
.Pp
The best strategy is playing kings and aces, because they have the
least chance of producing sequences. 10-value cards are generally good,
provided that the two cards laid away are not too near (likely to make
a sequence). When nothing better offers, give two wide cards, at least
three apart in rank.
.Pp
Proverbially the safest lead is a 4. The next card cannot make a 15. Lower
cards are also safe from this point of view, but are better treasured
for go and 31. The most dangerous leads are 7 and 8, but may be made to
trap the opponent when they are backed with other close cards.  Generally
speaking, play on (toward a sequence) when you have close cards and off
when you do not. However, the state of the score is a consideration. If
far behind, play on when there is any chance of building a score for
yourself; if well ahead, balk your opponent by playing off unless you
will surely peg as much as he by playing on.
.Pp
The user interface consists of selecting cards from your hand using jk
or arrow keys, making the choice with space. You can only make valid
choices. If there is only one card to play, it is played automatically.
Scoring of hands and plays is also handled by the computer, and fault
points are never awarded. The match consists of 7 games, after which
the match winner is declared and the game exits. You can also quit the
game at any time by pressing q or F10.
