This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

.SH NAME
getuid
\(em get a real user ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
uid_t getuid(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIgetuid\fR()
function shall return the real user ID of the calling process.
The
\fIgetuid\fR()
function shall not modify
.IR errno .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIgetuid\fR()
function shall always be successful and no return value is reserved to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Setting the Effective User ID to the Real User ID"
.P
The following example sets the effective user ID of the calling
process to the real user ID.

#include <unistd.h>

seteuid(getuid());
.fi
.P
.RE
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
In a conforming environment,
\fIgetuid\fR()
will always succeed. It is possible for implementations to provide
an extension where a process in a non-conforming environment
will not be associated with a user or group ID. It is recommended
that such implementations return (\c
.BR uid_t )\-1
and set
.IR errno
to indicate such an environment; doing so does not violate
this standard, since such an environment is already an extension.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
