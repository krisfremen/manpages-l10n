.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Starting with Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005), \fBpnmsplit\fP is
obsolete.  Use
.BR \fBpamsplit\fP (1)
 instead.

\fBpamsplit\fP is backward compatible with \fBpnmsplit\fP.  You can
use the \fBpamsplit\fP manual for \fBpnmsplit\fP as long as you ignore
features that were added after Netpbm 10.30.
