.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmmargin\fP adds a border around a PNM image.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
You can specify the border color with the \fB-white\fP,
\fB-black\fP, and \fB-color\fP options.  If no color is specified,
the program makes a guess.
.PP
To remove a border of a specified size from an image, use
\fBpamcut\fP.  \fBpnmcrop\fP also removes borders, but determines by itself
what is border and what is subject.
.PP
For lower level control, including to add different size borders to
different sides of the image, look at \fBpnmcat\fP.
.PP
If all you're trying to do is get the image up to a certain required
size, \fBpamcut\fP may be what you want.
.PP
\fBpnmpad\fP does essentially the same thing, but gives you more control
over the individual margins and does only black and white margins.
