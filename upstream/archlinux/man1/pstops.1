.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pstops
rearranges pages from a PostScript document, creating a new PostScript file.
The input PostScript file should follow the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions.
.I Pstops
can be used to perform arbitrary re-arrangements of
documents, including arranging for printing 2-up, 4-up, booklets, reversing,
selecting front or back sides of documents, scaling, etc.
.PP
.I pagespecs
follow the syntax:
.RS
.TP 12
.I pagespecs
=
.RI [ modulo\fB:\fP ] specs
.TP
.I specs
=
.IR spec [ \fB+\fPspecs | \fB,\fPspecs ]
.TP
.I spec
=
.RB [ - ] \fIpageno\fP [ L | R | U ][ H | V ][ @\fIscale\fP ][ ( \fIxoff\fP , \fIyoff\fP ) ]
.RE
.sp
.I modulo
is the number of pages in each block.
The value of
.I modulo
should be greater than 0; the default value is 1.
.PP
.I specs
are the page specifications for the pages in each block.
The value of the
.I pageno
in each
.I spec
should be between 0 (for the first page in the block) and \fImodulo\fR\-1
(for the last page in each block) inclusive.
If there is only one page specification,
the \fIpageno\fR (0) may be omitted.
.PP
The optional dimensions
.I xoff
and
.I yoff
shift the page by the specified amount.
.I xoff
and
.I yoff
may either be lengths (see
.BR psutils (1))
or followed by
.B "w"
or
.B "h"
to indicate a multiple of the width or height.
.PP
The optional parameters
.BR L ,
.BR R ,
.BR U ,
.BR H ,
and
.B V
rotate the page left, right, or upside-down, and flip (mirror) the page
horizontally or vertically respectively.
The optional
.I scale
parameter scales the page by the fraction specified.
If the optional minus sign is specified, the page number is relative to the end of
the document, instead of the start.
.PP
Pages whose
.IR spec s
are separated by
.B +
will be merged into a single page; otherwise,
they will remain as separate pages.
.PP
The shift, rotation, and scaling are applied
to the PostScript transformation matrix
in that order, regardless of the order
in which they appear on the command line.
.PP
The
.B \-w
option gives the width which is used by the
.B "w"
dimension specifier, and the
.B \-h
option gives the height which is used by the
.B "h"
dimension specifier.
The
.B \-p
option can be used as an alternative, to set the paper size.
See
.BR paper (1).
The
.B \-W
option gives the width of the input paper and the
.B \-H
option gives the height of the output paper.
The
.B \-P
option can be used as an alternative, to set the input paper size.
See
.BR paper (1).
These dimensions, if given are also used (after scaling) to set the
clipping path for each page.
.PP
The
.BI \-R pages
option specifies the pages which are to be selected.
.I Pages
is a comma separated list of page ranges, each of which may be a page number,
or a page range of the form
.IB first : last .
If
.I first
is omitted, the first page is assumed, and if
.I last
is omitted, the last page is assumed.

If an underscore character \[oq]_\[cq] is used instead of a page range,
a blank page will be inserted.

Page numbers refer to the pages as they occur in the file, starting
at one.
The actual page number in the document may be different.
.PP
The
.B \-e
option selects all of the even pages.
The
.B \-o
option selects all of the odd pages.
Either may be used in conjunction with
.B \-R
to select the even or odd pages from a range of pages.
.PP
The
.B \-r
option causes
.B psselect
to output the selected pages in reverse order.
.PP
The
.B \-b
option prevents any
.B bind
operators in the PostScript prolog from binding.
This may be needed for complex multi-page re-arrangements.
.PP
The
.B \-d
option draws a line around the border of each page, of the specified width.
If the \fIlwidth\fR parameter is omitted, it defaults to \fB1pt\fR.
The width is relative to the original page dimensions,
i.e., it is scaled with the rest of the page.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option gives the number of pages in each signature, which must be either 1
(the default), a multiple of 4, or, to put all pages in a single signature, 0.
.PP
Pstops normally prints the page numbers of the pages re-arranged; the
.B \-q
option suppresses this.
.SH EXAMPLES
To put two pages on one sheet of A4 paper, the pagespec to use is:
.sp
.ce
"2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"
.sp
To select all of the odd pages in reverse order, use:
.sp
.ce
2:-0
.sp
To re-arrange pages for printing 2-up booklets, use
.sp
.ce
"4:-3L@.7(21cm,0)+0L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"
.sp
for the front sides, and
.sp
.ce
"4:1L@.7(21cm,0)+-2L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"
.sp
for the reverse sides (or join them with a comma for duplex printing).
