.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpbmtog3\fP reads a PBM image as input and produces a Group 3 MH
fax file as output.
.PP
You can also generate a TIFF file that uses the same encoding
inside, with \fBpamtotiff\fP.
.PP
There is no program in Netpbm that generates other fax formats,
such as MR and MMR, but \fBpamtotiff\fP can generate TIFF files that
use those encodings.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-reversebits\fP
This option causes the output to have the bits in every byte
reversed so the least significant bit becomes the most significant bit.
Apparently, there is some ambiguity in transmission protocols so that
the bits get reversed on transmission, and this compensates for that.
If you get a whole bunch of "bad code word" messages when you try to
read the G3 file (e.g. with \fBg3topbm\fP), try using this option.
Note that the output is not G3 when you use this option.

.TP
\fB-nofixedwidth\fP
Most fax machines expect the image to be 1728 columns wide, so
\fBpbmtog3\fP cuts the output to this width by default.  If you want to
keep the width of the original image, use this option.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002).  Before that,
\fBpbmtog3\fP always kept the width of the original image.
