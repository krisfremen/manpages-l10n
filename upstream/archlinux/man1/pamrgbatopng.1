.SH NAME

pamrgbatopng - convert PAM color/transparency image to PNG

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamrgbatopng\fP
[\fIpamfile\fP]
.PP
Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use white
space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamrgbatopng\fP reads a PAM image with the RGB_ALPHA
tuple type (a color visual image with transparency) and produces an
equivalent PNG image as output.
.PP
The input image if from the file named by the \fIpamfile\fP argument,
or Standard Input if you don't specify \fIpamfile\fP.  The output goes
to Standard Output.
.PP
The maxval of the input image must be 255.  You can use
\fBpamdepth\fP to change the maxval of an image to 255 if necessary.
.PP
.BR \fBpnmtopng\fP (1)
 is a much more powerful
program for generating PNG images from Netpbm images, but it cannot
take PAM images with transparency as input.  To supply transparency
information, you must supply it in a separate PGM image.  That makes
it considerably less convenient to use.
.PP
(But note that \fBpnmtopng\fP takes PAM images, even with RGB_ALPHA
tuple type just fine -- it just ignores the alpha plane).
.PP
Netpbm's strategic direction is to add to \fBpnmtopng\fP all the
capabilities of \fBpamrgbatopng\fP and retire \fBpamrgbatopng\fP.
But there's no telling when that will happen.
