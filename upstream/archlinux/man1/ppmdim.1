.SH SYNOPSIS

ppmdim
\fIdimfactor\fP
[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
This program is largely obsoleted by the more general
.BR \fBpamfunc\fP (1)
 (use the \fB-multiplier\fP
option).  \fBppmdim\fP remains for backward compatibility and also
because its use of integer arithmetic may make it faster.

\fBppmdim\fP reads a PPM image input and diminishes its brightness by
the specified dimfactor.  The dimfactor may be in the range from 0.0
(total blackness, deep night, nada, null, nothing) to 1.0 (original
picture's brightness).
