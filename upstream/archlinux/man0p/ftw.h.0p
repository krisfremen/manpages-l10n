.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <ftw.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <ftw.h> 
header shall define the
.BR FTW
structure, which shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

int  base
int  level
.fi
.P
.RE
.P
The
.IR <ftw.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants for use as values
of the third argument to the application-supplied function that is
passed as the second argument to
\fIftw\fR()
and
\fInftw\fR():
.IP FTW_F 14
Non-directory file.
.IP FTW_D 14
Directory.
.IP FTW_DNR 14
Directory without read permission.
.IP FTW_DP 14
Directory with subdirectories visited.
.IP FTW_NS 14
Unknown type;
\fIstat\fR()
failed.
.IP FTW_SL 14
Symbolic link.
.IP FTW_SLN 14
Symbolic link that names a nonexistent file.
.P
The
.IR <ftw.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants for use as
values of the fourth argument to
\fInftw\fR():
.IP FTW_PHYS 14
Physical walk, does not follow symbolic links. Otherwise,
\fInftw\fR()
follows links but does not walk down any path that crosses itself.
.IP FTW_MOUNT 14
The walk does not cross a mount point.
.IP FTW_DEPTH 14
All subdirectories are visited before the directory itself.
.IP FTW_CHDIR 14
The walk changes to each directory before reading it.
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

int ftw(const char *, int (*)(const char *, const struct stat *,
    int), int);
int nftw(const char *, int (*)(const char *, const struct stat *,
    int, struct FTW *), int, int);

.RE
.P
The
.IR <ftw.h> 
header shall define the
.BR stat
structure and the symbolic names for
.IR st_mode
and the file type test macros as described in
.IR <sys/stat.h> .
.P
Inclusion of the
.IR <ftw.h> 
header may also make visible all symbols from
.IR <sys/stat.h> .
