.SH "NAME"
oomd.conf, oomd.conf.d \- Global \fBsystemd\-oomd\fR configuration files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/etc/systemd/oomd\&.conf
.PP
/etc/systemd/oomd\&.conf\&.d/*\&.conf
.PP
/usr/lib/systemd/oomd\&.conf\&.d/*\&.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These files configure the various parameters of the
\fBsystemd\fR(1)
userspace out\-of\-memory (OOM) killer,
\fBsystemd-oomd.service\fR(8)\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults\&. Initially, the main configuration file in
/etc/systemd/
contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator\&. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop\-ins, as described below\&. Using drop\-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file\&.
.PP
In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop\-in configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/\&. Those drop\-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file\&. Files in the
*\&.conf\&.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside\&. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files\&.
.PP
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop\-ins under
/usr/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. Drop\-ins have to be used to override package drop\-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\&.
.PP
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&.
.SH "[OOM] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are available in the [OOM] section:
.PP
\fISwapUsedLimitPercent=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the limit for swap usage on the system before
\fBsystemd\-oomd\fR
will take action\&. If the percentage of swap used on the system is more than what is defined here,
\fBsystemd\-oomd\fR
will act on eligible descendant cgroups, starting from the ones with the highest swap usage to the lowest swap usage\&. Which cgroups are monitored and what action gets taken depends on what the unit has configured for
\fIManagedOOMSwap=\fR\&. Takes a percentage value between 0% and 100%, inclusive\&. Defaults to 90%\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDefaultMemoryPressureLimitPercent=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the limit for memory pressure on the unit\*(Aqs cgroup before
\fBsystemd\-oomd\fR
will take action\&. A unit can override this value with
\fIManagedOOMMemoryPressureLimitPercent=\fR\&. The memory pressure for this property represents the fraction of time in a 10 second window in which all tasks in the cgroup were delayed\&. For each monitored cgroup, if the memory pressure on that cgroup exceeds the limit set for more than 30 seconds,
\fBsystemd\-oomd\fR
will act on eligible descendant cgroups, starting from the ones with the most reclaim activity to the least reclaim activity\&. Which cgroups are monitored and what action gets taken depends on what the unit has configured for
\fIManagedOOMMemoryPressure=\fR\&. Takes a percentage value between 0% and 100%, inclusive\&. Defaults to 60%\&.
