.SH NAME
sys/shm.h
\(em XSI shared memory facility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/shm.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <sys/shm.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants:
.IP SHM_RDONLY 12
Attach read-only (else read-write).
.IP SHM_RND 12
Round attach address to SHMLBA.
.IP SHMLBA 12
Segment low boundary address multiple.
.P
The
.IR <sys/shm.h> 
header shall define the following data types through
.BR typedef :
.IP "\fBshmatt_t\fP" 12
Unsigned integer used for the number of current attaches that must be
able to store values at least as large as a type
.BR "unsigned short" .
.P
The
.IR <sys/shm.h> 
header shall define the
.BR shmid_ds
structure, which shall include the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

struct ipc_perm shm_perm   \fROperation permission structure.\fR
size_t          shm_segsz  \fRSize of segment in bytes.\fR
pid_t           shm_lpid   \fRProcess ID of last shared memory operation.\fR
pid_t           shm_cpid   \fRProcess ID of creator.\fR
shmatt_t        shm_nattch \fRNumber of current attaches.\fR

The
.IR <sys/shm.h> 
header shall define the
.BR pid_t ,

types as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
