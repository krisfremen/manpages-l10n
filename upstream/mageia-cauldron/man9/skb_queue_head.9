.SH NAME
skb_queue_head \- insert an sk_buff at the head of a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <linux/skbuff.h>
.HP
.BI "void  __skb_queue_head(struct sk_buff_head " *list ", struct sk_buff " *newsk ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBskb_queue_head\fP function adds \fInewsk\fP to the head of \fIlist\fP.
Specifically, it sets the list, next, and prev pointers in \fInewsk\fP, and
increments the qlen element of \fIlist\fP.  It also rearranges the next
and prev pointers in the existing head of \fIlist\fP before returning.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
None.
.SH NOTES
It is important to note the difference between not only \fB__skb_queue_head\fP
and \fBskb_queue_head\fP, but all the \fB__skb_\fP functions and their
\fBskb_\fP counterparts.  Essentially, the \fB__skb_\fP functions are
non-atomic, and should only be used with interrupts disabled.  As a convenience,
the \fBskb_\fP functions are provided, which perform interrupt disable /
enable wrapper functionality in addition to performing their specific tasks.
