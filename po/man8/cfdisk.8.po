"In order to write the partition table B<cfdisk> needs something called the "
"`geometry' of the disk: the number of `heads' and the number of `sectors per "
"track'. Linux does not use any geometry, so if the disk will not be accessed "
"by other operating systems, you can safely accept the defaults that "
"B<cfdisk> chooses for you. The geometry used by B<cfdisk> is found as "
"follows. First the partition table is examined, to see what geometry was "
"used by the previous program that changed it. If the partition table is "
"empty, or contains garbage, or does not point at a consistent geometry, the "
"kernel is asked for advice. If nothing works 255 heads and 63 sectors/track "
"is assumed. The geometry can be overridden on the command line or by use of "
"the `g' command. When partitioning an empty large modern disk, picking 255 "
"heads and 63 sectors/track is always a good idea.  There is no need to set "
"the number of cylinders, since B<cfdisk> knows the disk size."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Next, B<cfdisk> tries to read the current partition table from the disk "
"drive.  If it is unable to figure out the partition table, an error is "
"displayed and the program will exit.  This might also be caused by incorrect "
"geometry information, and can be overridden on the command line.  Another "
"way around this problem is with the B<-z> option.  This will ignore the "
"partition table on the disk."

"The main display is composed of four sections, from top to bottom: the "
"header, the partitions, the command line and a warning line.  The header "
"contains the program name and version number followed by the disk drive and "
"its geometry.  The partitions section always displays the current partition "
"table.  The command line is the place where commands and text are entered.  "
"The available commands are usually displayed in brackets.  The warning line "
"is usually empty except when there is important information to be "
"displayed.  The current partition is highlighted with reverse video (or an "
"arrow if the B<-a> option is given).  All partition specific commands apply "
"to the current partition."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The format of the partition table in the partitions section is, from left to "
"right: Name, Flags, Partition Type, Filesystem Type and Size.  The name is "
"the partition device name.  The flags can be I<Boot>, which designates a "
"bootable partition or I<NC>, which stands for \"Not Compatible with DOS or "
"OS/2\".  DOS, OS/2 and possibly other operating systems require the first "
"sector of the first partition on the disk and all logical partitions to "
"begin on the second head.  This wastes the second through the last sector of "
"the first track of the first head (the first sector is taken by the "
"partition table itself).  B<cfdisk> allows you to recover these \"lost\" "
"sectors with the maximize command (B<m>).  I<Note:> B<fdisk>(8)  and some "
"early versions of DOS create all partitions with the number of sectors "
"already maximized.  For more information, see the maximize command below.  "
"The partition type can be one of I<Primary> or I<Logical>.  For unallocated "
"space on the drive, the partition type can also be I<Pri/Log>, or empty (if "
"the space is unusable).  The filesystem type section displays the name of "
"the filesystem used on the partition, if known.  If it is unknown, then "
"I<Unknown> and the hex value of the filesystem type are displayed.  A "
"special case occurs when there are sections of the disk drive that cannot be "
"used (because all of the primary partitions are used).  When this is "
"detected, the filesystem type is displayed as I<Unusable>.  The size field "
"displays the size of the partition in megabytes (by default).  It can also "
"display the size in sectors and cylinders (see the change units command "
"below).  If an asterisk (B<*>)  appears after the size, this means that the "
"partition is not aligned on cylinder boundaries."

"The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the first sector of "
