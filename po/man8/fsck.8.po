"B<fsck> is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux "
"filesystems.  I<filesys> can be a device name (e.g.  I</dev/hdc1>, I</dev/"
"sdb2>), a mount point (e.g.  I</>, I</usr>, I</home>), or an ext2 label or "
"UUID specifier (e.g.  UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or "
"LABEL=root).  Normally, the B<fsck> program will try to handle filesystems "
"on different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce the total amount of "
"time needed to check all of them."

"If no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the B<-A> option is "
