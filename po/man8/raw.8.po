"B<raw> is used to bind a Linux raw character device to a block device.  Any "
"block device may be used: at the time of binding, the device driver does not "
"even have to be accessible (it may be loaded on demand as a kernel module "
"later)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<raw> is used in two modes: it either sets raw device bindings, or it "
"queries existing bindings.  When setting a raw device, I</dev/raw/"
"rawE<lt>NE<gt>> is the device name of an existing raw device node in the "
"filesystem.  The block device to which it is to be bound can be specified "
"either in terms of its I<major> and I<minor> device numbers, or as a path "
"name I</dev/E<lt>blockdevE<gt>> to an existing block device file."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The bindings already in existence can be queried with the I<-q> option, "
"which is used either with a raw device filename to query that one device, or "
"with the I<-a> option to query all bound raw devices."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Unbinding can be done by specifying major and minor 0."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Once bound to a block device, a raw device can be opened, read and written, "
"just like the block device it is bound to.  However, the raw device does not "
"behave exactly like the block device.  In particular, access to the raw "
"device bypasses the kernel's block buffer cache entirely: all I/O is done "
"directly to and from the address space of the process performing the I/O.  "
"If the underlying block device driver can support DMA, then no data copying "
"at all is required to complete the I/O."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Because raw I/O involves direct hardware access to a process's memory, a few "
"extra restrictions must be observed.  All I/Os must be correctly aligned in "
"memory and on disk: they must start at a sector offset on disk, they must be "
"an exact number of sectors long, and the data buffer in virtual memory must "
"also be aligned to a multiple of the sector size.  The sector size is 512 "
"bytes for most devices."

"Raw I/O devices do not maintain cache coherency with the Linux block device "

"actual storage device underneath.  This is deliberate, but is regarded "
"either a bug or a feature depending on who you ask!"
