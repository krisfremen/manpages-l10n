#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fdisk> (in the first form of invocation)  is a menu-driven program for "
"creation and manipulation of partition tables.  It understands DOS-type "
"partition tables and BSD- or SUN-type disklabels."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fdisk> does not understand GUID partition tables (GPTs) and it is not "
"designed for large partitions.  In these cases, use the more advanced GNU "
"B<parted>(8)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fdisk> does not use DOS-compatible mode and cylinders as display units by "
"default.  The old deprecated DOS behavior can be enabled with the '-c=dos -"
"u=cylinders' command-line options."

"Hard disks can be divided into one or more logical disks called "
"I<partitions>.  This division is recorded in the I<partition table>, found "
"in sector 0 of the disk.  (In the BSD world one talks about `disk slices' "
"and a `disklabel'.)"

"Linux needs at least one partition, namely for its root file system.  It can "
"use swap files and/or swap partitions, but the latter are more efficient.  "
"So, usually one will want a second Linux partition dedicated as swap "
"partition.  On Intel-compatible hardware, the BIOS that boots the system can "
"often only access the first 1024 cylinders of the disk.  For this reason "
"people with large disks often create a third partition, just a few MB large, "
"typically mounted on I</boot>, to store the kernel image and a few auxiliary "
"files needed at boot time, so as to make sure that this stuff is accessible "
"to the BIOS.  There may be reasons of security, ease of administration and "
"backup, or testing, to use more than the minimum number of partitions."

"The I<device> is usually /dev/sda, /dev/sdb or so.  A device name refers to "
"the entire disk.  Old systems without libata (a library used inside the "
"Linux kernel to support ATA host controllers and devices) make a difference "
"between IDE and SCSI disks.  In such cases the device name will be /dev/hd* "
"(IDE) or /dev/sd* (SCSI)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The I<partition> is a device name followed by a partition number.  For "

msgstr ""

"A BSD/SUN-type disklabel can describe 8 partitions, the third of which "
"should be a `whole disk' partition.  Do not start a partition that actually "
"uses its first sector (like a swap partition) at cylinder 0, since that will "
"destroy the disklabel."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"An IRIX/SGI-type disklabel can describe 16 partitions, the eleventh of which "
"should be an entire `volume' partition, while the ninth should be labeled "
"`volume header'.  The volume header will also cover the partition table, i."
"e., it starts at block zero and extends by default over five cylinders.  The "
"remaining space in the volume header may be used by header directory "
"entries.  No partitions may overlap with the volume header.  Also do not "
"change its type or make some filesystem on it, since you will lose the "
"partition table.  Use this type of label only when working with Linux on "
"IRIX/SGI machines or IRIX/SGI disks under Linux."

"A DOS-type partition table can describe an unlimited number of partitions.  "
"In sector 0 there is room for the description of 4 partitions (called "
"`primary').  One of these may be an extended partition; this is a box "
"holding logical partitions, with descriptors found in a linked list of "
"sectors, each preceding the corresponding logical partitions.  The four "
"primary partitions, present or not, get numbers 1-4.  Logical partitions "
"start numbering from 5."

"In a DOS-type partition table the starting offset and the size of each "
"partition is stored in two ways: as an absolute number of sectors (given in "
"32 bits), and as a Cylinders/Heads/Sectors triple (given in 10+8+6 bits).  "
"The former is OK -- with 512-byte sectors this will work up to 2 TB.  The "
"latter has two problems.  First, these C/H/S fields can be filled only when "
"the number of heads and the number of sectors per track are known.  And "
"second, even if we know what these numbers should be, the 24 bits that are "
"available do not suffice.  DOS uses C/H/S only, Windows uses both, Linux "
"never uses C/H/S."

"If possible, B<fdisk> will obtain the disk geometry automatically.  This is "
"not necessarily the physical disk geometry (indeed, modern disks do not "
"really have anything like a physical geometry, certainly not something that "
"can be described in simplistic Cylinders/Heads/Sectors form), but it is the "
"disk geometry that MS-DOS uses for the partition table."

"Usually all goes well by default, and there are no problems if Linux is the "
"only system on the disk.  However, if the disk has to be shared with other "
"operating systems, it is often a good idea to let an fdisk from another "
"operating system make at least one partition.  When Linux boots it looks at "
"the partition table, and tries to deduce what (fake) geometry is required "
"for good cooperation with other systems."

"Whenever a partition table is printed out, a consistency check is performed "
"on the partition table entries.  This check verifies that the physical and "
"logical start and end points are identical, and that each partition starts "
"and ends on a cylinder boundary (except for the first partition)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Some versions of MS-DOS create a first partition which does not begin on a "
"cylinder boundary, but on sector 2 of the first cylinder.  Partitions "

"A sync() and an ioctl(BLKRRPART) (reread partition table from disk)  are "

"think this is the case anymore -- indeed, rebooting too quickly might cause "
"loss of not-yet-written data.  Note that both the kernel and the disk "

"The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the first sector of "

"The bottom line is that if you use cfdisk or fdisk to change the size of a "
"DOS partition table entry, then you must also use B<dd> to zero the first "
"512 bytes of that partition before using DOS FORMAT to format the "
"partition.  For example, if you were using cfdisk to make a DOS partition "

"Linux so that the partition table information is valid) you would use the "
