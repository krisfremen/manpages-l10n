"B<systemd-resolved> is a system service that provides network name "
"resolution to local applications\\&. It implements a caching and validating "
"DNS/DNSSEC stub resolver, as well as an LLMNR resolver and responder\\&. "
"Local applications may submit network name resolution requests via three "
"interfaces:"

"The native, fully-featured API B<systemd-resolved> exposes on the bus\\&. "
"See the \\m[blue]B<API Documentation>\\m[]\\&\\s-2\\u[1]\\d\\s+2 for details"
"\\&. Usage of this API is generally recommended to clients as it is "
"asynchronous and fully featured (for example, properly returns DNSSEC "
"validation status and interface scope for addresses as necessary for "
"supporting link-local networking)\\&."

"\\s-2\\u[2]\\d\\s+2 and its related resolver functions, including "
"B<gethostbyname>(3)\\&. This API is widely supported, including beyond the "
"Linux platform\\&. In its current form it does not expose DNSSEC validation "
"status information however, and is synchronous only\\&. This API is backed "
"by the glibc Name Service Switch (B<nss>(5))\\&. Usage of the glibc NSS "
"module B<nss-resolve>(8)  is required in order to allow glibc\\*(Aqs NSS "

"issuing DNS requests directly, bypassing any local API may be directed to "
"this stub, in order to connect them to B<systemd-resolved>\\&. Note however "
"that it is strongly recommended that local programs use the glibc NSS or bus "
