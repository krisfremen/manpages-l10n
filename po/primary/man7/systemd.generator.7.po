"Generators are small executables that live in /lib/systemd/system-"

"unit files (regular ones, instances as well as templates) and unit file \\&."
"d/ drop-ins, or create symbolic links to unit files to add additional "

"Generators found in directories listed earlier override the ones with the "
"same name in directories lower in the list\\&. A symlink to /dev/null or an "
"empty file can be used to mask a generator, thereby preventing it from "

"It is a good idea to use the I<SourcePath=> directive in generated unit "

"Generators may write out dynamic unit files or just hook unit files into "

"Regarding overriding semantics: there are two rules we try to follow when "

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"User configuration should override vendor configuration\\&. This (mostly) "
"means that stuff from /etc should override stuff from /usr\\&."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Native configuration should override non-native configuration\\&. This "
"(mostly) means that stuff you generate should never override native unit "
"files for the same purpose\\&."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Of these two rules the first rule is probably the more important one and "
"breaks the second one sometimes\\&. Hence, when deciding whether to use "
"argv[1], argv[2], or argv[3], your default choice should probably be "
"argv[1]\\&."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Instead of heading off now and writing all kind of generators for legacy "
"configuration file formats, please think twice! It is often a better idea to "
"just deprecate old stuff instead of keeping it artificially alive\\&."
