"\\*(Sd is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text "
"transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While "
"in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as "
"I<ed>), \\*(sd works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is "
"consequently more efficient.  But it is \\*(sd's ability to filter text in a "
"pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors."
