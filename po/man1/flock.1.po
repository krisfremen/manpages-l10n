"The first and second of the above forms wrap the lock around the execution "
"of a I<command>, in a manner similar to B<su>(1)  or B<newgrp>(1).  They "
"lock a specified I<file> or I<directory>, which is created (assuming "
"appropriate permissions) if it does not already exist.  By default, if the "
"lock cannot be immediately acquired, B<flock> waits until the lock is "
"available."
