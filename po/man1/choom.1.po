"The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0 "
"(never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted.  "
"The units are roughly a proportion along that range of allowed memory the "
"process may allocate from based on an estimation of its current memory and "
"swap use.  For example, if a task is using all allowed memory, its badness "
"score will be 1000.  If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score "
"will be 500."

"The amount of \"allowed\" memory depends on the context in which the oom "
"killer was called.  If it is due to the memory assigned to the allocating "
"task's cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mems "
"assigned to that cpuset.  If it is due to a mempolicy's node(s) being "
"exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes.  If it "
"is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed memory "
"is that configured limit.  Finally, if it is due to the entire system being "
"out of memory, the allowed memory represents all allocatable resources."

"The adjust score value is added to the badness score before it is used to "
"determine which task to kill.  Acceptable values range from -1000 to +1000.  "
"This allows userspace to polarize the preference for oom killing either by "
"always preferring a certain task or completely disabling it.  The lowest "
"possible value, -1000, is equivalent to disabling oom killing entirely for "
"that task since it will always report a badness score of 0."

"Setting an adjust score value of +500, for example, is roughly equivalent to "
"allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the same system, cpuset, mempolicy, "
"or memory controller resources to use at least 50% more memory.  A value of "
"-500, on the other hand, would be roughly equivalent to discounting 50% of "
"the task's allowed memory from being considered as scoring against the task."
