Most of the translations in this archive are based on English man pages which
are no longer available. Some notes about certain files:

man1/flex.1.po: Based on an old version of Flex. Still available from the
package »flex-old« (Debian only), but conflicting with the current »flex«
package. No way to maintain translations of both packages, that's why we
point to the current Flex package only.

man1/mc.1.po: Although no Spanish man page is there, man page translations are
obviously maintained within upstream development.

man1/passwd.1.po: Maintained upstream in the »shadow« package.

man1/pine.1.po: Based on the license-critical pine package. Translation is
still available as alpine.1.

man8/umount.8.po: Merged into mount.8.po some years ago.


If it happens that an original man page has been renamed and the content is
still available, we will move the .po file back to the current translations
in ../man*.
