"B<scanbd> is a scanner button monitoring daemon that can trigger execution "
"of scripts when a button on a scanner is pressed.  scanbd (the scanner "
"button daemon) opens and polls the scanner and therefore locks the device. "
"So no other application can access the device directly (open the /dev/..., "
"or via libusb, etc)."

"To enable scanning from applications, we use scanbm as a \"proxy\" for saned "
"to access the scanner from an application. scanbm listens for requests on "
"the saned network port for scanning requests.  If a scan request arrives, "
"scanbm requests the scanbd daemon to release the scanner.  Then it starts "
"the real saned which scans and sends the data back to the requesting "
"application. When the scanning is done and saned exits, the scanbm daemon "
"tells scanbd to resume polling the scanner."
