"RTCs should not be confused with the system clock, which is a software clock "
"maintained by the kernel and used to implement B<gettimeofday>(2)  and "
"B<time>(2), as well as setting timestamps on files, etc.  The system clock "
"reports seconds and microseconds since a start point, defined to be the "
"POSIX Epoch: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).  (One common implementation "
"counts timer interrupts, once per \"jiffy\", at a frequency of 100, 250, or "
"1000 Hz.)  That is, it is supposed to report wall clock time, which RTCs "
"also do."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A key difference between an RTC and the system clock is that RTCs run even "
"when the system is in a low power state (including \"off\"), and the system "
"clock can't.  Until it is initialized, the system clock can only report time "
"since system boot ... not since the POSIX Epoch.  So at boot time, and after "
"resuming from a system low power state, the system clock will often be set "
"to the current wall clock time using an RTC.  Systems without an RTC need to "
"set the system clock using another clock, maybe across the network or by "
"entering that data manually."
