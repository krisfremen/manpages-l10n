# manpages-nl

This is an attempt to partially reanimate a former localization project for
manpages, which resided at http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/man/index.html and
has been abandoned in 2001.

As far it is possible, we try to import the old and outdated Dutch textual
translations into *.po files. Moreover, we reuse UI strings. This means, we
create localized man pages using »helpman -L« and import the contents. This way
all man pages from the »coreutils« package are already present.

The tarball of the latest release is still available from:
https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/ftpdocs/linux-local/manpages/translations/man-pages-nl-0.13.3.tar.gz
