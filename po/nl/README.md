# manpages-nl

This is an attempt to reanimate the former project manpages-nl, which resided
at http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/man/index.html and has been abandoned in
2001.

As far it is possible, we try to import the old and outdated textual
translations into *.po files. Moreover, we reuse UI strings. This means, we
create localized man pages using »helpman -L« and import the contents. This way
all man pages from the »coreutils« package are already present.
