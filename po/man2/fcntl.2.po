"The Linux implementation of mandatory locking is subject to race conditions "
"which render it unreliable: a B<write>(2)  call that overlaps with a lock "
"may modify data after the mandatory lock is acquired; a B<read>(2)  call "
"that overlaps with a lock may detect changes to data that were made only "
"after a write lock was acquired.  Similar races exist between mandatory "
"locks and B<mmap>(2).  It is therefore inadvisable to rely on mandatory "
"locking."
