"systemd-machine-id-commit\\&.service is an early boot service responsible "
"for committing transient /etc/machine-id files to a writable disk file system"

"This service is started after local-fs\\&.target in case /etc/machine-id is "
"a mount point of its own (usually from a memory file system such as \"tmpfs"
"\") and /etc is writable\\&. The service will invoke B<systemd-machine-id-"
"setup --commit>, which writes the current transient machine ID to disk and "
"unmount the /etc/machine-id file in a race-free manner to ensure that file "
"is always valid and accessible for other processes\\&. See B<systemd-machine-"
"id-setup>(1)  for details\\&."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The main use case of this service are systems where /etc/machine-id is read-"
"only and initially not initialized\\&. In this case, the system manager will "
"generate a transient machine ID file on a memory file system, and mount it "
"over /etc/machine-id, during the early boot phase\\&. This service is then "
"invoked in a later boot phase, as soon as /etc has been remounted writable "
"and the ID may thus be committed to disk to make it permanent\\&."
