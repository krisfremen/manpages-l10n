"The /etc/machine-id file contains the unique machine ID of the local system "
"that is set during installation or boot\\&. The machine ID is a single "
"newline-terminated, hexadecimal, 32-character, lowercase ID\\&. When decoded "
"from hexadecimal, this corresponds to a 16-byte/128-bit value\\&. This ID "
"may not be all zeros\\&."

"The machine ID may be set, for example when network booting, with the "
