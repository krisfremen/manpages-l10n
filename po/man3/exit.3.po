"After B<exit>(), the exit status must be transmitted to the parent process.  "
"There are three cases.  If the parent has set B<SA_NOCLDWAIT>, or has set "
"the B<SIGCHLD> handler to B<SIG_IGN>, the status is discarded.  If the "
"parent was waiting on the child it is notified of the exit status.  In both "
"cases the exiting process dies immediately.  If the parent has not indicated "
"that it is not interested in the exit status, but is not waiting, the "
"exiting process turns into a \"zombie\" process (which is nothing but a "
"container for the single byte representing the exit status) so that the "
"parent can learn the exit status when it later calls one of the B<wait>(2)  "
