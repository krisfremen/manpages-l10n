"The B<libblkid> library is used to identify block devices (disks) as to "
"their content (e.g.  filesystem type) as well as extracting additional "
"information such as filesystem labels/volume names, unique identifiers/"
"serial numbers.  A common use is to allow use of LABEL= and UUID= tags "
"instead of hard-coding specific block device names into configuration files."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The low-level part of the library also allows to extract information about "
"partitions and block device topology."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The high-level part of the library keeps information about block devices in "
"a cache file and is verified to still be valid before being returned to the "
"user (if the user has read permission on the raw block device, otherwise "
"not).  The cache file also allows unprivileged users (normally anyone other "
"than root, or those not in the \"disk\" group) to locate devices by label/"
"id.  The standard location of the cache file can be overridden by the "
"environment variable BLKID_FILE."

"In situations where one is getting information about a single known device, "
"it does not impact performance whether the cache is used or not (unless you "
"are not able to read the block device directly)."

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The high-level part of the library supports two methods to evaluate LABEL/"
"UUID.  It reads information directly from a block device or read information "
"from /dev/disk/by-* udev symlinks.  The udev is preferred method by default."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"If you are dealing with multiple devices, use of the cache is highly "
"recommended (even if empty) as devices will be scanned at most one time and "
"the on-disk cache will be updated if possible."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable
msgid ""
"In some cases (modular kernels), block devices are not even visible until "
"after they are accessed the first time, so it is critical that there is some "
"way to locate these devices without enumerating only visible devices, so the "
"use of the cache file is B<required> in this situation."
