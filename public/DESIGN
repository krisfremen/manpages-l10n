This file describes the intended design and also tries to track the status

Worflow:
Upstream updates → (automatic) updated untranslated-XX.html

New language → (manual) updated index.html 
               (manual) translated strings for status pages

Repository updates → (automatic) updated status pages for all languages



Web tree logic:
index.html ­ Brief description of status, one link into each supported language and distribution (de,nl,fr) (archlinux, debian-buster, debian-unstable, mageia-cauldron) + Link to the untranslated file
             One language independen link into the repository
overview-$(dist)-$(lang).html - Overview page for translation statistics of $(dist) into $(lang)
untranslated-$(dist)-$(lang).html - Overview page for untranslated files of $(dist) into $(lang)


L10n logic:
All strings are separated into language dependent files
Option 1: At build time all supported languages are build (currently en,de,nl,fr)
Option 2: At request time the two files are merged
Depending on the browser configuration, the localized versions are delivered (if available)
TODO: Once logic is in place, request translation of the strings in as many as possible languages


Status and TODO:
Ideas summarized.
